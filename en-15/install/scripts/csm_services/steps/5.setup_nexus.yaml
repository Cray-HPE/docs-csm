    # Setup Nexus

    Run `./lib/setup-nexus.sh` to configure Nexus and upload CSM RPM repositories,
    container images, and Helm charts. This command may take 20 minutes or more to run.

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh
    ```

    On success, `setup-nexus.sh` will output to `OK` on stderr and exit with status
    code `0`, e.g.:

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh
    ...
    + Nexus setup complete
    setup-nexus.sh: OK

          Note that subsequent runs of `setup-nexus.sh` may report `FAIL` when uploading
          duplicate assets. This is ok as long as `setup-nexus.sh` outputs
          `setup-nexus.sh: OK` and exits with status code `0`.
