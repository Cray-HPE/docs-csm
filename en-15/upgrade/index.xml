      <description>CSM 1.4 to 1.5 Upgrade Process Introduction This document guides an administrator through the upgrade of Cray Systems Management from version 1.4 to version 1.5. This procedure works for all patch versions of the source and target CSM releases.&#xA;This procedure is also the correct one to follow in the unusual situation of upgrading from a pre-release version of CSM 1.5.0 to a newer version of CSM 1.5.&#xA;When upgrading a system, follow this top-level file from top to bottom.</description>

      <description>Upgrade only CSM This procedure describes how to upgrade Cray Systems Management (CSM) software on a CSM-only system without additional HPE Cray EX software products installed.&#xA;After the upgrade of CSM software, the CSM health checks will validate the system before doing any other operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components.&#xA;Prepare for upgrade Upgrade management nodes and CSM services Validate CSM health Check and update firmware Upgrade complete Note: If problems are encountered during the upgrade, some of the topics do have their own troubleshooting sections, but there is also a general troubleshooting topic.</description>

      <title>Validate CSM Health During a CSM Upgrade</title>

      <description>Validate CSM Health During a CSM Upgrade Before performing the health validation, be sure that at least 15 minutes have elapsed since the CSM services were upgraded. This allows the various Kubernetes resources to initialize and start. If the site does not use UAIs, then skip UAS and UAI validation. If UAIs are used, then before validating UAS and UAI, first validate any products that configure UAS (such as Cray Analytics and Cray Programming Environment); the procedures for this are beyond the scope of this document.</description>
