# Cabinet Routing
NCNs require additional routing to enable access to Mountain, Hill and River Compute cabinets.

Requires:
* Platform installation
* Running and configured SLS
* Can be run from PIT if passwordless SSH is set up to all NCNs, but should be run post ncn-m001 reboot.

Apply the script in `/opt/cray/csm/workarounds/livecd-post-reboot/CASMINST-1570/CASMINST-1570.sh`.
