    # Create Site-Init Secret

    The `site-init` secret in the `loftsman` namespace makes
    `${PITDATA}/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml` available to product
    installers. The `site-init` secret should only be updated when the
    corresponding `customizations.yaml` data is changed, such as during system
    installation or upgrade. Create the `site-init` secret to contain
    `${PITDATA}/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml`:
