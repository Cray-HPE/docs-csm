      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how the CSM upgrade process is automated.&#xA;Overview In a nutshell, an upgrade is:&#xA;Upload new artifacts into a running system. Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images. Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded. Prerequisites Everything that is needed before upgrading an NCN.&#xA;NOTE:&#xA;The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002 (at different points in the upgrade process).</description>
