# Cray System Management Installation Guide

### Scope and Audience

The documentation included here describes how to install or upgrade the Cray System Management (CSM)
software and related supporting operational procedures.  CSM software is the foundation upon which
other software product streams for the HPE Cray EX system depend.

The CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management
nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage.  These nodes
perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage
nodes with the Ceph storage.

System services on these nodes are provided as containerized microservices packaged for deployment
as helm charts.  These services are orchestrated by Kubernetes to be scheduled on Kubernetes worker
nodes with horizontal scaling to increase or decrease the number of instances of some services as 
demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.

This information is intended for system installers, system administrators, and network administrators
of the system.  It assumes some familiarity with standard Linux and open source tools, such as shell
scripts, Ansible, YAML, JSON, and TOML file formats, etc.
