## 1. Install CSM services

> **`NOTE`**: During this step, only on systems with only three worker nodes (typically Testing and  Development Systems (TDS)), the `customizations.yaml` file will be
> automatically edited to lower pod CPU requests for some services, in order to better facilitate scheduling on smaller systems. See the file
> `${CSM_PATH}/tds_cpu_requests.yaml` for these settings. This file can be modified with different values (prior to executing the
> `yapl` command below), if other settings are desired in the `customizations.yaml` file for this system. For more information about modifying `customizations.yaml`
> and tuning for specific systems, see
> [Post-Install Customizations](../operations/CSM_product_management/Post_Install_Customizations.md).

1. (`pit#`) Install YAPL.

   ```bash
   rpm -Uvh "${CSM_PATH}"/rpm/cray/csm/sle-15sp2/x86_64/yapl-*.x86_64.rpm
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Install CSM services using YAPL.

   ```bash
   pushd /usr/share/doc/csm/install/scripts/csm_services
   yapl -f install.yaml execute
   popd
   ```

   > **`NOTE`**
   >
   > * This command may take up to 90 minutes to complete.
   > * If any errors are encountered, then potential fixes should be displayed where the error occurred.
   > * Output is redirected to `/usr/share/doc/csm/install/scripts/csm_services/yapl.log` . To show the output in the terminal, append
   >   the `--console-output execute` argument to the `yapl` command.
   > * The `yapl` command can safely be rerun. By default, it will skip any steps which were previously completed successfully. To force it to
   >   rerun all steps regardless of what was previously completed, append the `--no-cache` argument to the `yapl` command.
   > * The order of the `yapl` command arguments is important. The syntax is `yapl -f install.yaml [--console-output] execute [--no-cache]`.

## 2. Create base BSS global boot parameters

1. (`pit#`) Wait for BSS to be ready.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n services rollout status deployment cray-bss
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Retrieve an API token.

   ```bash
   export TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
                     -d client_id=admin-client \
                     -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
                     https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Create empty boot parameters:

   ```bash
   curl -i -k -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X PUT \
       https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootparameters \
       --data '{"hosts":["Global"]}'
   ```

   Example of successful output:

   ```text
   HTTP/2 200
   content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
   date: Mon, 27 Jun 2022 17:08:55 GMT
   content-length: 0
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 7
   server: istio-envoy
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Restart the `spire-update-bss` job.

   ```bash
   SPIRE_JOB=$(kubectl -n spire get jobs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=spire-update-bss -o name)
   kubectl -n spire get "${SPIRE_JOB}" -o json | jq 'del(.spec.selector)' \
       | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels."controller-uid")' \
       | kubectl replace --force -f -
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Wait for the `spire-update-bss` job to complete.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n spire wait "${SPIRE_JOB}" --for=condition=complete --timeout=5m
   ```

## 3. Adding Switch Admin Password to Vault

This is required for some of our automated tests.

Add the switch credentials into Vault.
Certain tests, including `goss-switch-bgp-neighbor-aruba-or-mellanox` use these credentials to test the state of the switch.
This step is not required to configure the management network.
If Vault is unavailable, this step can be temporarily skipped.
Any automated tests that depend on the switch credentials being in Vault will fail until they are added.

Run the following commands to add switch admin password to Vault.

```bash
VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r '.data["vault-root"]' |  base64 -d)
alias vault='kubectl -n vault exec -i cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env VAULT_TOKEN="$VAULT_PASSWD" VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_FORMAT=json vault'
vault kv put secret/net-creds/switch_admin admin=SWITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD'
```

## 4. Wait for everything to settle

Wait **at least 15 minutes** to let the various Kubernetes resources initialize and start before proceeding with the rest of the install.
Because there are a number of dependencies between them, some services are not expected to work immediately after the install script completes.

1. After having waited until services are healthy (run `kubectl get po -A | grep -v 'Completed\|Running'` to see which pods may still be `Pending`), take a manual backup of all Etcd clusters.
These clusters are automatically backed up every 24 hours, but not until the clusters have been up that long.
Taking a manual backup enables restoring from backup later in this install process if needed.

   ```bash
   /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/etcd/take-etcd-manual-backups.sh post_install
   ```

1. The next step is to validate CSM health before redeploying the final NCN. See [Validate CSM health before final NCN deployment](./README.md#3-validate-csm-health-before-final-ncn-deployment).

## Known issues

### `Deploy CSM Applications and Services` known issues

The following error may occur during the `Deploy CSM Applications and Services` step:

```text
+ csi upload-sls-file --sls-file /var/www/ephemeral/prep/eniac/sls_input_file.json
2021/10/05 18:42:58 Retrieving S3 credentials ( sls-s3-credentials ) for SLS
2021/10/05 18:42:58 Unable to SLS S3 secret from k8s:secrets "sls-s3-credentials" not found
```

1. (`pit#`) Verify that the `sls-s3-credentials` secret exists in the `default` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret sls-s3-credentials
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME                 TYPE     DATA   AGE
   sls-s3-credentials   Opaque   7      28d
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Check for running `sonar-sync` jobs. If there are no `sonar-sync` jobs, then wait for one to complete. The `sonar-sync` `CronJob` is responsible
   for copying the `sls-s3-credentials` secret from the `default` namespace to the `services` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n services get pods -l cronjob-name=sonar-sync
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
   sonar-sync-1634322840-4fckz   0/1     Completed   0          73s
   sonar-sync-1634322900-pnvl6   1/1     Running     0          13s
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Verify that the `sls-s3-credentials` secret now exists in the `services` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n services get secret sls-s3-credentials
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME                 TYPE     DATA   AGE
   sls-s3-credentials   Opaque   7      20s
   ```

1. Running the `yapl` command again is expected to succeed.
