# Configure Aruba Leaf Switch

This page describes how Aruba leaf switches are configured and will show users how to validate configuration.

Leaf switches are located in air-cooled cabinets and provide connectivity to components in those cabinets.
Aruba JL762A 6300M 48G 4SFP56 is the model used.

Requirements:
    - Two uplinks from the switch to the upstream switch, this is can be an aggregation switch or a spine switch.

Here are example snippets from a leaf switch in the SHCD.

   | Source | Source Label Info | Destination Label Info | Destination | Description |
   | --- | --- | ---| --- | --- | 
   | sw-smn01 | x3000u40-j49 | x3105u38-j47 | sw-25g01 | 25g-15m-LC-LC |
   | sw-smn01 | x3000u40-j50 | x3105u39-j47 | sw-25g02 | 25g-15m-LC-LC |


The uplinks are port 49 and 50 on the leaf.  They connect to Aggregation switch 1 and 2 on port 47.

It is assumed that you have connectivity to the switch and have done the [Configure Aruba Management Network Base](configure_aruba_management_network_base.md) procedure.


## Configure Uplink
The uplink ports are the ports connecting the leaf switches to the upstream switch.

1. Create the LAG.
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
   interface lag 99
       no shutdown
       no routing
       vlan trunk native 1
       vlan trunk allowed all
       lacp mode active
       exit
   ```

2. Add ports to the LAG
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
   interface 1/1/49 - 1/1/50
       no shutdown
       mtu 9198
       lag 99
       exit
   ```

## Configure VLAN

**Cray Site Init (CSI) generates the IPs used by the system, below are samples only.**
The VLAN information is located in the network yaml files.  Below are examples.
1. The leaf switches will have VLAN interfaces in NMN and the HMN networks.

   ```
   sif-ncn-m001-pit:/var/www/ephemeral/prep/sif/networks # cat NMN.yaml
   SNIPPET
     - ip_address: 10.252.0.4
       name: sw-leaf-001
       comment: x3000c0w14
       aliases: []
     name: network_hardware
     net-name: NMN
     vlan_id: 2
     comment: ""
     gateway: 10.252.0.1
   ```
   ```
   sif-ncn-m001-pit:/var/www/ephemeral/prep/sif/networks # cat HMN.yaml
   SNIPPET
     - ip_address: 10.254.0.4
       name: sw-leaf-001
       comment: x3000c0w14
       aliases: []
     name: network_hardware
     net-name: HMN
     vlan_id: 4
     comment: ""
     gateway: 10.254.0.1
   ```

1. NMN VLAN config
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       vlan 2
       interface vlan2
       description RIVER_NMN
       ip address 10.252.0.4/17
       exit
   ```
1. HMN VLAN config
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       vlan 4
       interface vlan4
       description RIVER_HMN
       ip address 10.254.0.4/17
       exit
   ```

## Configure SNMP

1. This configuration is required for hardware discovery of the Shasta system.
   ```
   snmp-server vrf default
   snmpv3 user testuser auth md5 auth-pass plaintext testpass1 priv des priv-pass plaintext testpass2
   ```

## Configure ACL

These ACLs are designed to block traffic from the node management network to and from the hardware management network.

1. The first step is to create the access list, once it's created we have to apply it to a VLAN.

   NOTE: these are examples only, the IP addresses below need to match what was generated by CSI.
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       access-list ip nmn-hmn
       10 deny any 10.252.0.0/255.255.128.0 10.254.0.0/255.255.128.0 
       20 deny any 10.252.0.0/255.255.128.0 10.104.0.0/255.252.0.0
       30 deny any 10.254.0.0/255.255.128.0 10.252.0.0/255.255.128.0 
       40 deny any 10.254.0.0/255.255.128.0 10.100.0.0/255.252.0.0
       50 deny any 10.100.0.0/255.252.0.0 10.254.0.0/255.255.128.0 
       60 deny any 10.100.0.0/255.252.0.0 10.104.0.0/255.252.0.0
       70 deny any 10.104.0.0/255.252.0.0 10.252.0.0/255.255.128.0 
       80 deny any 10.104.0.0/255.252.0.0 10.100.0.0/255.252.0.0
       90 permit any any any
   ```

1. Apply ACL to a VLANs
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       vlan 2
       name RVR_NMN
       apply access-list ip nmn-hmn in
       apply access-list ip nmn-hmn out
       vlan 4
       name RVR_HMN
       apply access-list ip nmn-hmn in
       apply access-list ip nmn-hmn out
   ```

## Configure Spanning-tree

1. The following configuration is applied to Aruba leaf/Aggregation switches.
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       spanning-tree mode rpvst
       spanning-tree
       spanning-tree vlan 1,2,4
   ```

## Configure OSPF

1. OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol used to exchange routes.
   It provides reachability from the leaf switch to k8s
   The router-id used here is the NMN ip address. (VLAN 2 IP) 

   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       router ospf 1
       router-id 10.252.0.x
       interface vlan2
       ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.2
       interface vlan4
       ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.4
   ```

## Configure NTP

1. The IPs used here will be the first three worker nodes on the NMN network.  These can be found in NMN.yaml.
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       ntp server 10.252.1.7
       ntp server 10.252.1.8
       ntp server 10.252.1.9
       ntp enable
   ```

## Configure DNS

1. This will point to the unbound DNS server. 
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       ip dns server-address 10.92.100.225
   ```

## Configure Edge port

1. Ports that need to be on the HMN (hardware management network) This would include BMCs/PDUs
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       interface 1/1/35
       no shutdown
       no routing
       vlan access 4
       spanning-tree bpdu-guard
       spanning-tree port-type admin-edge
   ```

1. Ports that need to be on the NMN (node management network).  This would include air-cooled compute nodes.
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       interface 1/1/35
       no shutdown
       no routing
       vlan access 2
       spanning-tree bpdu-guard
       spanning-tree port-type admin-edge
   ```

## Configure Apollo Server port

1. iLO BMC port
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)#
       interface 1/1/46 
       no shutdown 
       no routing
       vlan trunk native 1
       vlan trunk allowed 4
       spanning-tree bpdu-guard
       spanning-tree port-type admin-edge
       exit 
   ```
1. NMN port from OCP card
   ```
   interface 1/1/14 
       no shutdown 
       no routing
       vlan access 2
       spanning-tree bpdu-guard
       spanning-tree port-type admin-edge
       exit 
   ```

## Save configuration
   ```
   sw-leaf-001(config)# exit
   sw-leaf-001# write memory
   ```


## Show Running Configuration

   ```
   sw-leaf-001# show running-config
   ```
