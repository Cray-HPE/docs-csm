In order for PXE booting to work successfully, the management network switches need to be configured correctly.

## Configuration required for PXE booting

To successfully PXE boot nodes, the following is required:

- The `ip helper-address` must be configured on VLANs 1, 2, 4, and 7. This will be where the layer 3 gateway exists (spine or leaf).
- The virtual-IP/VSX/MAGP IP address must be configured on VLANs 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- `spine01` and `spine02` need an active gateway on VLAN 1; this can be identified from `MTL.yaml` generated by CSI.
- `spine01` and `spine02` need an `ip helper-address` on VLAN 1 pointing to `10.92.100.222`.

## Switch configuration

### Aruba configuration

1. (`sw-spine#`) Check the configuration for `interface vlan x`.

    This configuration will be the same on BOTH Switches (except the `ip address`).
    There will be an `active-gateway` and `ip helper-address` configured.

    ```console
    int vlan 1,2,4,7
    show run current-context
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    interface vlan 1
        ip mtu 9198
        ip address 10.1.0.2/16
        active-gateway ip mac 12:00:00:00:6b:00
        active-gateway ip 10.1.0.1
        ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
    interface vlan 2
        vsx-sync active-gateways
        ip mtu 9198
        ip address 10.252.0.2/17
        active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
        active-gateway ip 10.252.0.1
        ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
        ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.0
    interface vlan 4
        vsx-sync active-gateways
        ip mtu 9198
        ip address 10.254.0.2/17
        active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
        active-gateway ip 10.254.0.1
        ip helper-address 10.94.100.222
        ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.0
    interface vlan 7
        ip mtu 9198
        ip address 10.103.11.1/24
        active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
        active-gateway ip 10.103.11.111
        ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
    ```

1. (`sw-spine#`) If any of this configuration is missing, then update it on BOTH switches.

    ```console
    conf t
    int vlan 1
    ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
    active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
    active-gateway ip 10.1.0.1

    conf t
    int vlan 2
    ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
    active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
    active-gateway ip 10.252.0.1

    conf t
    int vlan 4
    ip helper-address 10.94.100.222
    active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00

    conf t
    int vlan 7
    ip helper-address 10.92.100.222
    active-gateway ip mac 12:01:00:00:01:00
    active-gateway ip xxxxxxx
    write mem
    ```

### Mellanox configuration

1. (`sw-spine#`) Check the configuration for `interface vlan 1`.

    This configuration will be the same on BOTH Switches (except the `ip address`).
    `magp` and `ip dhcp relay` will be configured.

    ```console
    show run int vlan 1
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    interface vlan 1
    interface vlan 1 ip address 10.1.0.2/16 primary
    interface vlan 1 ip dhcp relay instance 2 downstream
    interface vlan 1 magp 1
    interface vlan 1 magp 1 ip virtual-router address 10.1.0.1
    interface vlan 1 magp 1 ip virtual-router mac-address 00:00:5E:00:01:01
    ```

1. (`sw-spine#`) If this configuration is missing, then add it to BOTH switches.

    ```console
    conf t
    interface vlan 1 magp 1
    ip virtual-router address 10.1.0.1
    ip virtual-router mac-address 00:00:5E:00:01:01
    conf t
    ip dhcp relay instance 2 vrf default
    ip dhcp relay instance 2 address 10.92.100.222
    interface vlan 2 ip dhcp relay instance 2 downstream
    ```

1. (`sw-spine#`) Verify the VLAN 1 MAGP configuration.

    ```console
    show magp 1
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    MAGP 1:
      Interface vlan: 1
      Admin state   : Enabled
      State         : Master
      Virtual IP    : 10.1.0.1
      Virtual MAC   : 00:00:5E:00:01:01
    ```

1. (`sw-spine#`) Verify the DHCP relay configuration.

    ```console
    show ip dhcp relay instance 2
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    VRF Name: default

    DHCP Servers:
      10.92.100.222

    DHCP relay agent options:
      always-on         : Disabled
      Information Option: Disabled
      UDP port          : 67
      Auto-helper       : Disabled

    vlan7       N/A               downstream
    ```

1. (`sw-spine#`) Verify that the route to the TFTP server and the route for the ingress gateway are available.

    ```console
    show ip route 10.92.100.60
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    Flags:
      F: Failed to install in H/W
      B: BFD protected (static route)
      i: BFD session initializing (static route)

                                          c        10.252.0.6        vlan2            bgp        200/0
                                          c        10.252.0.7        vlan2            bgp        200/0
    ```

    ```console
    show ip route 10.92.100.71
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

    ```

## Next steps

If the configuration looks good and PXE boot is still not working, then there are some other things to try.

### Node iPXE retries and NIC order

In some environments, during the [Deploy Final NCN: Reboot](deploy_final_non-compute_node.md#4-reboot) step, `ncn-m001` may loop through all of its NICs and still fail to PXE boot,
even after the third chain attempt. The NIC boot ordering used by default is designed to be optimal for multiple types of hardware and cabling, but it may need to be
edited for specific environments in order to reduce the boot time of `ncn-m001`.

If the boot issues described above are observed, then follow the steps in
[Edit the iPXE Embedded Boot Script](../operations/boot_orchestration/Edit_the_iPXE_Embedded_Boot_Script.md), adjusting the NIC boot order such that `net0`,
or others, come before `net2`. If that does not resolve the issue, then return to this page.

### Restart BSS

Restart the Boot Script Service (BSS) if the following output is returned on the console
during an NCN PXE boot attempt (specifically the `404 Not Found` error at the bottom):

```text
https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript...X509 chain 0x6d35c548 added X509 0x6d360d68 "eniac.dev.cray.com"
X509 chain 0x6d35c548 added X509 0x6d3d62e0 "Platform CA - L1 (a0b073c8-5c9c-4f89-b8a2-a44adce3cbdf)"
X509 chain 0x6d35c548 added X509 0x6d3d6420 "Platform CA (a0b073c8-5c9c-4f89-b8a2-a44adce3cbdf)"
EFITIME is 2021-02-26 21:55:04
HTTP 0x6d35da88 status 404 Not Found
```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Rollout a restart of the BSS deployment.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-bss
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    deployment.apps/cray-bss restarted
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Wait for the roll out to complete.

    Wait for this command to return (it will block showing status as the pods are refreshed).

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services rollout status deployment cray-bss
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-bss" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
    deployment "cray-bss" successfully rolled out
    ```

1. Reboot the NCN that failed to PXE boot.

### Restart Kea

In some cases, rebooting the Kea pod has resolved PXE issues.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Get the Kea pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n services | grep kea
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    cray-dhcp-kea-6bd8cfc9c5-m6bgw                                 3/3     Running     0          20h
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete the Kea pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pods -n services cray-dhcp-kea-6bd8cfc9c5-m6bgw
    ```

### Missing BSS data

If the PXE boot is giving 404 errors, this could be because the necessary information is not in BSS. The
information is uploaded into BSS with the `csi handoff bss-metadata` and `csi handoff bss-update-cloud-init`
commands in the [Deploy Final NCN Handoff Data](deploy_final_non-compute_node.md#31-handoff-data) procedure. If these commands
failed or were skipped accidentally, then this will cause the `ncn-m001` PXE boot to fail.

In that case, then use the following recovery procedure.

1. Reboot to the PIT.

    - **If using a remote ISO PIT**, skip to the next step.
    - **If using a USB PIT**, follow this procedure:

        1. Reboot the PIT node, watching the console as it boots.

        1. Manually stop it at the boot menu.

        1. Select the USB device for the boot.

        1. Once booted, log in and mount the data partition. See:

           - [First log in](pre-installation.md#13-first-log-in)
           - [Prepare the data partition](pre-installation.md#14-prepare-the-data-partition)

1. (`pit#`) Set variables for the system name, the CAN IP address for `ncn-m002`, the Kubernetes version, and the Ceph version.

    If needed, the typescript file from that procedure should be on `ncn-m002` and `ncn-m003` in the `/metal/bootstrap/prep/admin` directory.

    Substitute the correct values for the system in use in the following commands:

    ```bash
    CAN_IP_NCN_M002=$(ssh ncn-m002 ip -4 a show bond0.can0 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d / -f1)
    ```

1. (`pit#`) **If using a remote ISO PIT**, then run the following commands to finish configuring the network and copy files.

    **Skip these steps if using a USB PIT**.

    1. Run the following command to copy files from `ncn-m002` to the PIT node.

        ```bash
        scp -p ${CAN_IP_NCN_M002}:/metal/bootstrap/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/pit-files/* /etc/sysconfig/network/
        ```

    1. Apply the network changes.

        ```bash
        wicked ifreload all
        systemctl restart wickedd-nanny && sleep 5
        ```

    1. Copy `data.json` from `ncn-m002` to the PIT node.

        ```bash
        mkdir -p /var/www/ephemeral/configs
        scp ${CAN_IP_NCN_M002}:/metal/bootstrap/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/basecamp/data.json /var/www/ephemeral/configs
        ```

1. (`pit#`) Copy Kubernetes configuration file from `ncn-m002`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -pv ~/.kube
    scp ${CAN_IP_NCN_M002}:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Set DNS to use Unbound.

    ```bash
    echo "nameserver 10.92.100.225" > /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Export the API token.

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
        -d client_id=admin-client \
        -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
        https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Re-run the [BSS handoff commands from the Deploy Final NCN procedure](deploy_final_non-compute_node.md#31-handoff-data).

    > ***WARNING*** These commands should never be run from a node other than the PIT node, or `ncn-m001` during handoff**

    ```bash
    csi handoff bss-metadata --data-file /var/www/ephemeral/configs/data.json || echo "ERROR: csi handoff bss-metadata failed"
    csi handoff bss-update-cloud-init --set meta-data.dns-server=10.92.100.225 --limit Global
    ```

1. Perform the [Restart BSS](#restart-bss) and the [Restart Kea](#restart-kea) procedures.

1. Reboot the PIT node.
