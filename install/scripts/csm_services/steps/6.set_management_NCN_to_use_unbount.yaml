    # Set Management NCNs to use Unbound

    First, verify that SLS properly reports all management NCNs in the system:

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/list-ncns.sh
    ```

    On success, each management NCN will be output, e.g.:

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/list-ncns.sh
    + Getting admin-client-auth secret
    + Obtaining access token
    + Querying SLS
    ncn-m001
    ncn-m002
    ncn-m003
    ncn-s001
    ncn-s002
    ncn-s003
    ncn-w001
    ncn-w002
    ncn-w003
    ```

    If any management NCNs are missing from the output, take corrective action before
    proceeding.

    Next, run `lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh` to SSH to each management NCN and update
    /etc/resolv.conf to use Unbound as the nameserver.

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh
    ```

    > **`NOTE`** If passwordless SSH is not configured, the administrator will have
    > to enter the corresponding password as the script attempts to connect to each
    > NCN.

    On success, the nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf will be printed
    for each management NCN, e.g.,:

    ```bash
    pit# ./lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh
    + Getting admin-client-auth secret
    + Obtaining access token
    + Querying SLS
