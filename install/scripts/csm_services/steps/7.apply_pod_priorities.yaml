    # Apply Pod Priorities

    Run the `add_pod_priority.sh` script to create and apply a pod priority class to services critical to CSM. This will give these services a higher priority than others to ensure they get scheduled by Kubernetes in the event that resources are limited on smaller deployments.

    ```bash
    pit# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0/scripts/upgrade/add_pod_priority.sh
    Creating csm-high-priority-service pod priority class
    priorityclass.scheduling.k8s.io/csm-high-priority-service configured

    Patching cray-postgres-operator deployment in services namespace
    deployment.apps/cray-postgres-operator patched

    Patching cray-postgres-operator-postgres-operator-ui deployment in services namespace
    deployment.apps/cray-postgres-operator-postgres-operator-ui patched

    Patching istio-operator deployment in istio-operator namespace
    deployment.apps/istio-operator patched

    Patching istio-ingressgateway deployment in istio-system namespace
    deployment.apps/istio-ingressgateway patched
    .
    .
    .
    ```

    After running the `add_pod_priority.sh` script, the affected pods will be restarted as the pod priority class is applied to them.
