# Configure Management Network

HPE Cray EX systems can have network switches in many roles: spine switches, leaf switches, leaf-bmc switches, and CDU switches.
Newer systems have HPE Aruba switches, while older systems have Dell and Mellanox switches. Switch IP addresses are generated by Cray Site Init (CSI).

Documentation for the Management Network can be found in the [HPE Cray EX Management Network Installation and Configuration Guide](../operations/network/management_network/README.md).

The configuration for these switches will be generated from CSM Automated Network Utility (CANU)
Documentation for CANU can be found at https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu

It is assumed that the administrator configuring the Management Network has a basic understanding of networking protocols (STP, VLAN, OSPF, LAG/MLAG, BGP, etc.), and knows how to configure network equipment. It is also assumed that they understand and know how to read an SHCD file.

Before configuring/reconfiguring any switches, make sure to get the current running configuration and save that in case the configuration must be reverted.

All switch configuration should be done with a console or out of band connection.

Save the output of the following by dumping the text configuration of the switch:

```bash
show running-configuration
```

## Details

### HPE Aruba Switch Configuration

The management network switches should be configured in this order: Spine, Leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and Leaf-BMC.
Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled cabinets
will have Leaf switches.

### Dell and Mellanox Switch Configuration

The management network switches should be configured in this order: Spine, Leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and Leaf-BMC.
Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled
cabinets will have Leaf switches.

On a typical system, the Mellanox switches are Spine switches and the Dell switches are used for Leaf, CDU, and Leaf-BMC switches.

## Site Connections

Currently CANU ***does not*** automatically create site connections (LAGs/uplink interfaces or default routes).

Hence, administrators need to manually configure the uplinks for site connections as well as default routes.

Example configuration:

**`NOTE`** These are very simplistic examples and depending on the install scenario, administrators may need to also configure LAGs, etc.
