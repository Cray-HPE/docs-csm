# Configure Management Network

HPE Cray EX systems can have network switches in many roles: spine switches, leaf switches, `leaf-bmc` switches, and
[Coolant Distribution Unit (CDU)](../glossary.md#coolant-distribution-unit-cdu) switches.
Newer systems have HPE Aruba switches, while older systems have Dell and Mellanox switches. Switch IP addresses are generated by
[Cray Site Init (CSI)](../glossary.md#cray-site-init-csi).

Documentation for the Management Network can be found in the [HPE Cray EX Management Network Installation and Configuration Guide](../operations/network/management_network/README.md).

The configuration for these switches will be generated from the [CSM Automatic Network Utility (CANU)](../glossary.md#csm-automatic-network-utility-canu).
For more details, see the [CANU documentation](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu).

It is assumed that the administrator configuring the Management Network has a basic understanding of networking protocols (STP, VLAN, OSPF, LAG/MLAG, BGP, etc.), and knows how to configure network
equipment. It is also assumed that they understand and know how to read a [Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD)](../glossary.md#shasta-cabling-diagram-shcd) file.

Before configuring/reconfiguring any switches, make sure to get the current running configuration and save that in case the configuration must be reverted.

All switch configuration should be done with a console or out of band connection.

(`sw#`) Save the output of the following by dumping the text configuration of the switch:

```console
show running-configuration
```

## Details

### HPE Aruba switch configuration

The management network switches should be configured in this order: spine, leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and `leaf-bmc`.
Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled cabinets
will have leaf switches.

### Dell and Mellanox switch configuration

The management network switches should be configured in this order: spine, leaf (if present), CDU (if present), and `leaf-bmc`.
Only systems with liquid-cooled cabinets will have the CDU switches. Only systems with many nodes in air-cooled
cabinets will have leaf switches.

On a typical system, the Mellanox switches are spine switches and the Dell switches are used for leaf, CDU, and `leaf-bmc`.

## Site connections

Currently CANU ***does not*** automatically create site connections (LAGs/uplink interfaces or default routes).

Hence, administrators need to manually configure the uplinks for site connections as well as default routes.

Example configuration:

**`NOTE`** These are very simplistic examples and depending on the install scenario, administrators may need to also configure LAGs, etc.

### Site connections: Mellanox

`sw#`

```console
enable
conf term
interface ethernet 1/16 no switchport force
interface ethernet 1/16 speed 10G force
interface ethernet 1/16 vrf forwarding Customer
interface ethernet 1/16 ip address 10.102.255.10/30 primary
ip route vrf Customer 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.3.3
ip route vrf Customer 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.255.9
```

### Site connections: Aruba

`sw#`

```console
config
interface 1/1/16
vrf attach Customer
ip address 10.102.255.10/30
no shutdown
exit
ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.102.3.3 vrf Customer
ip route 0.0.0.0/0 0.102.255.9 vrf Customer
```

After completing this procedure, collect MAC addresses for the [management nodes](../glossary.md#management-nodes)
using the [PIT](../glossary.md#pre-install-toolkit-pit) node and the management network switches configured in this procedure.

See [Collect MAC Addresses For NCNs](collect_mac_addresses_for_ncns.md).
