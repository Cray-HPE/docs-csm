# Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation

This page details how to wipe NCN disks.

> **Everything in this section should be considered DESTRUCTIVE**.

After following these procedures, an NCN can be rebooted and redeployed.

All types of disk wipe can be run from Linux or from an initramFS/initrd emergency shell.

<a name="use-cases"></a>
The following are potential use cases for wiping disks:

   * Adding a node that is not bare.
   * Adopting new disks that are not bare.
   * Doing a fresh install.

## Basic Wipe

A basic wipe includes wiping the disks and all of the RAIDs. These basic wipe instructions can be
executed on **any type of management node** (master, storage, or worker).

1. List the disks for verification.

    ```bash
    ncn# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
    ```

1. Wipe the disks and the RAIDs.

    ```bash
    ncn# wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
    ```

    If any disks had labels present, then the output looks similar to the following:

    ```
    /dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
    /dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
    /dev/sda: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa
    /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000000 (crypto_LUKS): 4c 55 4b 53 ba be
    /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00004000 (crypto_LUKS): 53 4b 55 4c ba be
    /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
    /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
    /dev/sdc: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa
    ```

    Verify that there are no error messages in the output.

    The `wipefs` command may fail if no labeled disks are found, which is an indication of a larger problem.

## Advanced Wipe

**This section is specific to utility storage nodes**. An advanced wipe includes stopping Ceph, 
deleting the Ceph volumes, and then wiping the disks and RAIDs.

1. Stop Ceph.

    * ***CSM 0.9 or earlier***

        ```bash
        ncn-s# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
        ```

    * ***CSM 1.0 or later***

        ```bash
        ncn-s# cephadm rm-cluster --fsid $(cephadm ls|jq -r '.[0].fsid') --force
        ```

1. Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running.

    * ***CSM 0.9 or earlier***

        ```bash
        ncn-s# ps -ef|grep ceph-osd
        ```

    * ***CSM 1.0 or later***

        ```bash
        ncn-s# podman ps
        ```

    Examine the output. There should be no running `ceph-osd` processes or containers.

1. Remove the Ceph volume groups.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# vgremove -f -v --select 'vg_name=~ceph*'
    ```

1. Perform the [Basic Wipe](#basic-wipe) procedure.

<a name="full-wipe"></a>
## Full-Wipe

This section is preferred method for all nodes. A full wipe includes deleting the Ceph volumes (where applicable), stopping the
RAIDs, zeroing the disks, and then wiping the disks and RAIDs.

**IMPORTANT:** For each step, pay attention to whether the command is to be run on a master node, storage node, or worker node. If
wiping a different type of node than what a step specifies, then skip that step.

1. Reset Kubernetes on each worker node.

   This will stop kubelet, underlying containers, and remove the contents of `/var/lib/kubelet`.

   **NOTE:** The recommended order is to do this on the worker nodes, and then the master nodes.

    1. For each worker node, run the following:

       1.  Reset Kubernetes.

        ```bash
        ncn-w# kubeadm reset --force
        ```

       1. List any containers running in `containerd`.

           ```bash
           ncn-w# crictl ps
           CONTAINER           IMAGE               CREATED              STATE               NAME                                                ATTEMPT             POD ID

       1. If there are any running containers from the output of the `crictl ps` command, stop them.

           ```bash
           ncn-w# crictl stop <container id from the CONTAINER column>
        ```

1. Reset Kubernetes on each master node.

   This will stop kubelet, underlying containers, and remove the contents of `/var/lib/kubelet`.

    1. Reset Kubernetes.

       1.  Reset Kubernetes.
        ```bash
        ncn-m# kubeadm reset --force

       1. If there are any running containers from the output of the `crictl ps` command, stop them.

           ```bash
           ncn-m# crictl stop <container id from the CONTAINER column>
           ```


1. Delete Ceph Volumes **on storage nodes ONLY**.

    For each storage node, perform the following steps:

    1. Stop Ceph.

        * ***CSM 0.9 or earlier***

            ```bash
            ncn-s# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
            ```

        * ***CSM 1.0 or later***

            ```bash
            ncn-s# cephadm rm-cluster --fsid $(cephadm ls|jq -r '.[0].fsid') --force
            ```

    1. Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running.

        * ***CSM 0.9 or earlier***

            ```bash
            ncn-s# ps -ef|grep ceph-osd
            ```

        * ***CSM 1.0 or later***

            ```bash
            ncn-s# podman ps
            ```

        Examine the output. There should be no running `ceph-osd` processes or containers.

    1. Remove the Ceph volume groups.

        ```bash
        ncn-s# vgremove -f -v --select 'vg_name=~ceph*'
        ```

1. Unmount the volumes.

    > **NOTE:** Some of the following `umount` commands may fail or have warnings depending on the state of the NCN. Failures in this
    > section can be ignored and will not inhibit the wipe process.
    >
    > **NOTE:** There is an edge case where the overlay may keep the drive from being unmounted. If this is a rebuild, ignore this.

    The exact commands used depends on the node type:

    * **Master nodes**

        Stop the `etcd` service on the master node before unmounting `/var/lib/etcd` and other mounts.

        ```bash
        ncn-m# systemctl stop etcd.service
        ncn-m# umount -v /run/lib-etcd /var/lib/etcd /var/lib/sdu

        ```

    * **Storage nodes**

        ```bash
        ncn-s# umount -vf /var/lib/ceph /var/lib/containers /etc/ceph
        ```

        If the `umount` command is responding with `target is busy` on the storage node, then try the following:

        1. Look for `containers` mounts:

            ```bash
            ncn-s# mount | grep "containers"
            /dev/mapper/metalvg0-CONTAIN on /var/lib/containers type xfs (rw,noatime,swalloc,attr2,largeio,inode64,allocsize=131072k,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
            /dev/mapper/metalvg0-CONTAIN on /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay type xfs (rw,noatime,swalloc,attr2,largeio,inode64,allocsize=131072k,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
            ```

        1. Unmount `/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay`.

            ```bash
            ncn-s# umount -v /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay
            umount: /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay unmounted
            ```

        1. Unmount `/var/lib/containers`.

            ```bash
            ncn-s# umount -v /var/lib/containers
            umount: /var/lib/containers unmounted
            ```

    * **Worker nodes**

        ```bash
        ncn-w# umount -v /var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/sdu /run/containerd /var/lib/containerd /run/lib-containerd /var/opt/cray/sdu/collection-mount /var/lib/admin-tools /var/lib/s3fs_cache /var/lib/containerd
        ```

1. Stop `cray-sdu-rda` on **all node types** (master, storage, or worker).

    1. See if any `cray-sdu-rda` containers are running.

        ```bash
        ncn# podman ps
        CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                                      COMMAND               CREATED      STATUS          PORTS   NAMES
        7741d5096625  registry.local/sdu-docker-stable-local/cray-sdu-rda:1.1.1  /bin/sh -c /usr/s...  6 weeks ago  Up 6 weeks ago          cray-sdu-rda
        ```

    1. If there is a running `cray-sdu-rda` container in the above output, then stop it using the container ID:

        ```bash
        ncn# podman stop 7741d5096625
        7741d50966259410298bb4c3210e6665cdbd57a82e34e467d239f519ae3f17d4
        ```

1. Remove `etcd` device **on master nodes ONLY**.

    1. Determine whether or not an `etcd` volume is present.

      ```bash
      ncn-m# dmsetup ls
      ```

        Expected output when the `etcd` volume is present will show `ETCDLVM`, but the numbers might be different.

        ```
        ETCDLVM (254:1)
        ```

    1. Remove the `etcd` device mapper.

      ```bash
      ncn-m# dmsetup remove $(dmsetup ls | grep -i etcd | awk '{print $1}')
      ```

        > **NOTE:** The following output means the `etcd` volume mapper is not present. This is okay.
        ```
        No device specified.
        Command failed.
        ```

1. Remove `etcd` volumes **on master nodes ONLY**.

   ```bash
   ncn-m# vgremove etcdvg0
   ```

1. Remove metal LVM on **all node types** (master, storage, or worker).

     ```bash
     ncn# vgremove -f -v --select 'vg_name=~metal*'
     ```

    > **NOTE:** Optionally, run the `pvs` command. If any drives are still listed, then remove them with `pvremove`, but this is rarely needed. Also, if the above command fails or returns a warning about the filesystem being in use, ignore the error and proceed to the next step. This will not inhibit the wipe process.

1. Wipe the disks and RAIDs on **all node types** (master, storage, or worker).

    If wiping multiple nodes, this group of commands should be done in succession on one node before moving to do the same set of commands on the next node. 
    The nodes should be addressed in descending order for each type of node. Start with the utility storage nodes, then the worker nodes, then `ncn-m003`, and finally `ncn-m002`.

    > **WARNING:** Do not run these commands on `ncn-m001`

    1. List the disks for verification.

        ```bash
        ncn# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
        ```

       ```bash
       ncn# wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
       ```

       If any disks had labels present, output from `wipefs` looks similar to the following:

       ```
       /dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
       /dev/sda: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
       /dev/sda: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa
       /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000000 (crypto_LUKS): 4c 55 4b 53 ba be
       /dev/sdb: 6 bytes were erased at offset 0x00004000 (crypto_LUKS): 53 4b 55 4c ba be
       /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
       /dev/sdc: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x6fc86d5e00 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54
       /dev/sdc: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x000001fe (PMBR): 55 aa
       ```

        Verify that there are no error messages in the output.

        The `wipefs` command may fail if no labeled disks are found, which is an indication of a larger problem.
