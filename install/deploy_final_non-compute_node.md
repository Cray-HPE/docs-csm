# Deploy Final NCN

The following procedure contains information for rebooting and deploying the management node that is currently
hosting the LiveCD. At the end of this procedure, the LiveCD will no longer be active. The node it was using will
join the Kubernetes cluster as the final of three master nodes, forming a quorum.

**IMPORTANT:** While the node is rebooting, it will only be available through Serial-Over-LAN (SOL) and local terminals. This
procedure entails deactivating the LiveCD, meaning the LiveCD and all of its resources will be unavailable.

## 1. Required services

These services must be healthy before the reboot of the LiveCD can take place. If the health checks performed earlier in the install
completed successfully \([Validate CSM Health](../operations/validate_csm_health.md)\), then the following platform services will be healthy
and ready for reboot of the LiveCD:

* Utility Storage (Ceph)
* `cray-bss`
* `cray-dhcp-kea`
* `cray-dns-unbound`
* `cray-ipxe`
* `cray-sls`
* `cray-tftp`

## 2. Notice of danger

> An administrator is **strongly encouraged** to be mindful of pitfalls during this segment of the CSM install.
> The steps below do contain warnings themselves, but overall there are risks:
>
> * SSH will cease to work when the LiveCD reboots; the serial console will need to be used.
> * Rebooting a remote ISO will dump all running changes on the PIT node; USB devices are accessible after the install.
> * The NCN **will never wipe a USB device** during installation.
> * Prior to shutting down the PIT node, learning the CMN IP addresses of the other NCNs will be helpful if
>   troubleshooting is required.
>
> This procedure entails deactivating the LiveCD, meaning the LiveCD and all of its resources will be **unavailable**.

## 3. Handoff

The steps in this section load hand-off data before a later procedure reboots the LiveCD node.

### 3.1 Handoff data

1. (`pit#`) Start a new typescript.

    1. Exit the current typescript, if one is active.

        ```bash
        exit
        ```

    1. Start a new typescript on the PIT node.

        ```bash
        mkdir -pv "${PITDATA}"/prep/admin &&
             pushd "${PITDATA}"/prep/admin &&
             script -af "csm-livecd-reboot.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
        export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
        ```

1. (`pit#`) Upload SLS file.

    > **`NOTE`** The environment variable `SYSTEM_NAME` must be set.

    ```bash
    csi upload-sls-file --sls-file "${PITDATA}/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/sls_input_file.json"
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    2021/02/02 14:05:15 Retrieving S3 credentials ( sls-s3-credentials ) for SLS
    2021/02/02 14:05:15 Uploading SLS file: /var/www/ephemeral/prep/eniac/sls_input_file.json
    2021/02/02 14:05:15 Successfully uploaded SLS Input File.
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Upload NCN boot artifacts into S3.

    1. Upload Kubernetes NCN artifacts.

        ```bash
        set -o pipefail
        IMS_UPLOAD_SCRIPT=$(rpm -ql docs-csm | grep ncn-ims-image-upload.sh) &&
            export IMS_ROOTFS_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-m002/rootfs)" &&
            export IMS_INITRD_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-m002/initrd.img.xz)"  &&
            export IMS_KERNEL_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-m002/kernel)"  &&
            K8S_IMS_IMAGE_ID=$($IMS_UPLOAD_SCRIPT) &&
            [[ -n ${K8S_IMS_IMAGE_ID} ]] &&
            echo -e "Kubernetes NCN image IMS ID: ${K8S_IMS_IMAGE_ID}\nSUCCESS"
        ```

        Ensure that the output from the above command chain ends with `SUCCESS`.

    1. Upload Storage NCN artifacts.

        ```bash
        export IMS_ROOTFS_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-s001/rootfs)" &&
            export IMS_INITRD_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-s001/initrd.img.xz)" &&
            export IMS_KERNEL_FILENAME="$(readlink -f /var/www/ncn-s001/kernel)" &&
            STORAGE_IMS_IMAGE_ID=$($IMS_UPLOAD_SCRIPT) &&
            [[ -n ${STORAGE_IMS_IMAGE_ID} ]] &&
            echo -e "Storage NCN image IMS ID: ${STORAGE_IMS_IMAGE_ID}\nSUCCESS"
        ```

        Ensure that the output from the above command chain ends with `SUCCESS`.

1. (`pit#`) Get a token to use for authenticated communication with the gateway.

    > **`NOTE`** `api-gw-service-nmn.local` is legacy, and will be replaced with `api-gw-service.nmn`.

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id=admin-client \
                    -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
                    https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Upload the `data.json` file to BSS, the `cloud-init` data source.

    > **`NOTE`** This step will prompt for the root password of the NCNs.

    ```bash
    csi handoff bss-metadata \
        --data-file "${PITDATA}/configs/data.json" \
        --kubernetes-ims-image-id "$K8S_IMS_IMAGE_ID" \
        --storage-ims-image-id "$STORAGE_IMS_IMAGE_ID" && echo SUCCESS
    ```

    Ensure that the output from the above command chain ends with `SUCCESS`.

1. (`pit#`) Patch the metadata for the Ceph nodes to have the correct run commands.

    ```bash
    python3 /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/patch-ceph-runcmd.py
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Ensure that the DNS server value is correctly set to point toward Unbound at `10.92.100.225` (NMN) and `10.94.100.225` (HMN).

    ```bash
    csi handoff bss-update-cloud-init --set meta-data.dns-server="10.92.100.225 10.94.100.225" --limit Global
    ```

### 3.2 Prepare for rebooting

1. (`pit#`) Set and trim the boot order on the PIT node.

    This only needs to be done for the PIT node, not for any of the other NCNs. See
    [Setting boot order](../background/ncn_boot_workflow.md#setting-boot-order) and
    [Trimming boot order](../background/ncn_boot_workflow.md#trimming-boot-order).

1. (`pit#`) Tell the PIT node to PXE boot on the next boot.

    ```bash
    efibootmgr -n $(efibootmgr | grep -m1 -Ei "ip(v4|4)" | awk '{match($0, /[[:xdigit:]]{4}/, m); print m[0]}') | grep -i bootnext
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Collect a backdoor login. Fetch the CMN IP address for `ncn-m002` for a backdoor during the reboot of `ncn-m001`.

    1. Get the IP address.

        ```bash
        ssh ncn-m002 ip -4 a show bond0.cmn0 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d / -f1
        ```

        Expected output will look similar to the following (exact values may differ):

        ```text
        10.102.11.13
        ```

    1. (`external#`) Log in from an external machine to verify that SSH is up and running for this session.

        ```bash
        ssh root@10.102.11.13
        ```

        > Keep this terminal active as it will enable `kubectl` commands during the bring-up of the new NCN.
        > If the reboot successfully deploys the LiveCD, then this terminal can be exited.

### 3.3 Backup

It is important to backup some files from `ncn-m001` before it is rebooted.

1. (`pit#`) Set up passwordless SSH **to** the PIT node from `ncn-m002`.

    > The `ssh` command below may prompt for the NCN root password.

    ```bash
    ssh ncn-m002 cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys &&
        chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Stop the typescript session.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Preserve logs and configuration files if desired.

    The following commands create a `tar` archive of select files on the PIT node. This archive is located
    in a directory that will be backed up in the next steps.

    ```bash
    mkdir -pv "${PITDATA}"/prep/logs &&
         ls -d \
            /etc/dnsmasq.d \
            /etc/os-release \
            /etc/sysconfig/network \
            /opt/cray/tests/cmsdev.log \
            /opt/cray/tests/install/logs \
            /opt/cray/tests/logs \
            /root/.canu \
            /root/.config/cray/logs \
            /root/csm*.{log,txt} \
            /tmp/*.log \
            /usr/share/doc/csm/install/scripts/csm_services/yapl.log \
            /var/log/conman \
            /var/log/zypper.log 2>/dev/null |
         sed 's_^/__' |
         xargs tar -C / -czvf "${PITDATA}/prep/logs/pit-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).tgz"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Copy some of the installation files to `ncn-m002`.

    These files will be copied back to `ncn-m001` after the PIT node is rebooted.

    ```bash
    ssh ncn-m002 \
        "mkdir -pv /metal/bootstrap
         rsync -e 'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -rltD -P --delete pit.nmn:'${PITDATA}'/prep /metal/bootstrap/
         rsync -e 'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -rltD -P --delete pit.nmn:'${CSM_PATH}'/images/pre-install-toolkit/pre-install-toolkit*.iso /metal/bootstrap/"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Upload install files to S3 in the cluster.

    ```bash
    PITBackupDateTime=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
    tar -czvf "${PITDATA}/PitPrepIsoConfigsBackup-${PITBackupDateTime}.tgz" "${PITDATA}/prep" "${PITDATA}/configs" "${CSM_PATH}/images/pre-install-toolkit/pre-install-toolkit"*.iso &&
    cray artifacts create config-data \
        "PitPrepIsoConfigsBackup-${PITBackupDateTime}.tgz" \
        "${PITDATA}/PitPrepIsoConfigsBackup-${PITBackupDateTime}.tgz" &&
    rm -v "${PITDATA}/PitPrepIsoConfigsBackup-${PITBackupDateTime}.tgz" && echo COMPLETED
    ```

    Ensure that the previous command chain output ends with `COMPLETED`, indicating that the procedure was successful.

## 4. Reboot

1. (`external#`) Open a serial console to the PIT node, if one is not already open.

    Open it from a system external to the cluster. It can be a laptop or any other system with network connectivity to the cluster.

    > This example uses `ipmitool`, but any method for accessing the console of `ncn-m001` is acceptable.

    1. Start a typescript, set helper variables, and enter the BMC password for `ncn-m001`.

        ```bash
        script -a boot.livecd.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt
        export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
        SYSTEM_NAME=eniac
        USERNAME=root
        read -r -s -p "ncn-m001 BMC ${USERNAME} password: " IPMI_PASSWORD
        ```

    1. Open the console connection.

        ```bash
        export IPMI_PASSWORD
        ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H "${SYSTEM_NAME}-ncn-m001-mgmt" chassis power status
        ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H "${SYSTEM_NAME}-ncn-m001-mgmt" sol activate
        ```

1. (`pit#`) Reboot the LiveCD.

    > **POINT OF NO RETURN** When the PIT node boots as `ncn-m001`, it will wipe its disks clean. It will ignore USB devices.
    > Remote ISOs are also at risk here; even though a backup has been performed of the PIT node, it is not possible to
    > boot back to the same state.

    ```bash
    reboot
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Wait for the node to boot, acquire its hostname (`ncn-m001`), and run `cloud-init`.

    > **`NOTE`** If the node has PXE boot issues, such as getting PXE errors or not pulling the `ipxe.efi` binary, see [PXE boot troubleshooting](troubleshooting_pxe_boot.md).
    If the node comes up and indicates `Failed to start etcd` -- see [Fix `Failed to start etcd` on Master NCN](../operations/kubernetes/Fix_Failed_to_start_etcd_on_Master.md).

1. (`external#`) Once `cloud-init` has completed successfully, log in and start a typescript (the IP address used here is the one noted for `ncn-m002` in an earlier step).

    ```bash
    ssh root@10.102.11.13

    pushd /metal/bootstrap/prep/admin
    script -af "csm-verify.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
    export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
    ssh ncn-m001
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Run `kubectl get nodes` to see the full Kubernetes cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
    ncn-m001   Ready    control-plane,master   3m31s   v1.22.13
    ncn-m002   Ready    control-plane,master   115m    v1.22.13
    ncn-m003   Ready    control-plane,master   114m    v1.22.13
    ncn-w001   Ready    <none>                 114m    v1.22.13
    ncn-w002   Ready    <none>                 114m    v1.22.13
    ncn-w003   Ready    <none>                 112m    v1.22.13
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Restore and verify the site link.

    Restore networking files from the manual backup taken during the
    [Backup](#33-backup) step.

    > **`NOTE`** Do NOT change any default NCN hostname; otherwise, unexpected deployment or upgrade errors may happen.

    ```bash
    SYSTEM_NAME=eniac
    rsync "ncn-m002:/metal/bootstrap/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/pit-files/ifcfg-lan0" /etc/sysconfig/network/ && \
        wicked ifreload lan0 && \
        wicked ifstatus lan0
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to:

    ```text
    lan0            up
       link:     #32, state up, mtu 1500
       type:     bridge, hwaddr 90:e2:ba:0f:11:c2
       config:   compat:suse:/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-lan0
       leases:   ipv4 static granted
       addr:     ipv4 172.30.53.88/20 [static]
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Verify that there **is not** a metal bootstrap IP address.

    ```bash
    ip a show bond0
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Download and install/upgrade the documentation RPM.

    If this machine does not have direct internet access, then this RPM will need to be
    externally downloaded and then copied to this machine.

    See [Check for Latest Documentation](../update_product_stream/README.md#check-for-latest-documentation).

1. Move the backup to `ncn-m001`.

    This is required to facilitate reinstallations, because it pulls the preparation data back over to the documented area (`ncn-m001`).

    1. (`ncn-m001#`) Exit out of `ncn-m001`, back to `ncn-m002`.

        ```bash
        exit
        ```

    1. (`ncn-m002#`) Exit the typescript.

        ```bash
        exit
        ```

    1. (`ncn-m002#`) Copy install files back to `ncn-m001`.

        ```bash
        rsync -rltDv -P /metal/bootstrap ncn-m001:/metal/ && rm -rfv /metal/bootstrap
        ```

    1. (`ncn-m002#`) Log out of `ncn-m002`.

        ```bash
        exit
        ```

    1. Log in to `ncn-m001`.

        SSH back into `ncn-m001` or log in at the console.

    1. (`ncn-m001#`) Resume the typescript.

        ```bash
        script -af "/metal/bootstrap/prep/admin/csm-verify.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
        export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
        ```

## 5. Enable NCN disk wiping safeguard

The next steps require `csi` from the installation media. `csi` will not be provided on an NCN otherwise because
it is used for Cray installation and bootstrap.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Obtain access to CSI.

    ```bash
    mkdir -pv /mnt/livecd /mnt/sqfs && \
        mount -v /metal/bootstrap/pre-install-toolkit-*.iso /mnt/livecd/ && \
        mount -v /mnt/livecd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /mnt/sqfs/ && \
        cp -pv /mnt/sqfs/usr/bin/csi /tmp/csi && \
        /tmp/csi version && \
        umount -vl /mnt/sqfs /mnt/livecd
    ```

    > **`NOTE`** `/tmp/csi` will delete itself on the next reboot. The `/tmp` directory is `tmpfs` and runs in memory;
    > it will not persist on restarts.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Authenticate with the cluster.

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id=admin-client \
                    -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
                    https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Set the wipe safeguard to allow safe reboots on all NCNs.

    ```bash
    /tmp/csi handoff bss-update-param --set metal.no-wipe=1
    ```

## 6. Update select RPMs

(`ncn-m001`) Run the following command to ensure that select RPMs on `ncn-m001` are at the correct version.

```bash
/usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/scripts/upgrade/util/upgrade-test-rpms.sh --local
```

If the output ends with `PASSED`, then it was successful, despite any warning messages that may have been displayed.

## 7. Configure DNS and NTP on each BMC

 > **`NOTE`** Only follow this section if the NCNs are HPE hardware. If the system uses
 > Gigabyte or Intel hardware, then skip this section.

Configure DNS and NTP on the BMC for each management node **except `ncn-m001`**.
However, the commands in this section are all run **on** `ncn-m001`.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Validate that the system is HPE hardware.

    ```bash
    ipmitool mc info | grep "Hewlett Packard Enterprise" || echo "Not HPE hardware -- SKIP this section"
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Set environment variables.

    Set the `IPMI_PASSWORD` and `USERNAME` variables to the BMC credentials for the NCNs.

    > **`NOTE`** Using `read -s` for this prevents the credentials from being echoed to the screen or saved in the shell history.

    ```bash
    USERNAME=root
    read -r -s -p "NCN BMC ${USERNAME} password: " IPMI_PASSWORD
    ```

    ```bash
    export IPMI_PASSWORD USERNAME
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Set `BMCS` variable to list of the BMCs for all master, worker, and storage nodes,
   except `ncn-m001-mgmt`:

    ```bash
    readarray BMCS < <(grep mgmt /etc/hosts | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v m001 | sort -u | tr '\n' ' ')
    for BMC in ${BMCS[@]}; do echo ${BMC}; done
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    ncn-m002-mgmt
    ncn-m003-mgmt
    ncn-s001-mgmt
    ncn-s002-mgmt
    ncn-s003-mgmt
    ncn-w001-mgmt
    ncn-w002-mgmt
    ncn-w003-mgmt
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Get the DNS server IP address for the HMN.

    ```bash
    HMN_DNS=$(kubectl get services -n services -o wide | awk /cray-dns-unbound-udp-hmn/'{printf "%s%s", sep, $4; sep=","} END{print ""}'); echo ${HMN_DNS}
    ```

    Example output for a single DNS server:

    ```text
    10.94.100.225
    ```

    Example output for multiple DNS servers:

    ```text
    10.94.100.225,10.94.100.224,10.94.100.223
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Run the following to loop through all of the BMCs (except `ncn-m001-mgmt`) and apply the desired settings.

    ```bash
    for BMC in ${BMCS[@]}; do
        echo "${BMC}: Disabling DHCP and configure NTP on the BMC using data from unbound service"
        /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/set-bmc-ntp-dns.sh ilo -H "${BMC}" -S -n
        echo
        echo "${BMC}: Configuring DNS on the BMC using data from unbound"
        /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/set-bmc-ntp-dns.sh ilo -H "${BMC}" -D "${HMN_DNS}" -d
        echo
        echo "${BMC}: Showing settings"
        /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/set-bmc-ntp-dns.sh ilo -H "${BMC}" -s
        echo
    done ; echo "Configuration completed on all NCN BMCs"
    ```
