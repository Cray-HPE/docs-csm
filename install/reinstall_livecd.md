# Reinstall LiveCD

Setup a re-install of LiveCD on a node using the previous configuration.

1. Backup to the data partition:

    ```bash
     mkdir -pv /var/www/ephemeral/backup
     pushd /var/www/ephemeral/backup
     tar -czvf "dnsmasq-data-$(date  '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').tar.gz" /etc/dnsmasq.*
     tar -czvf "network-data-$(date  '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').tar.gz" /etc/sysconfig/network/*
     cp -pv /etc/hosts ./
     popd
     umount -v /var/www/ephemeral
    ```

1. Unplug the USB device.

   The USB device should now contain all the information already loaded, as well as the backups of
   the initialized files.

1. Plug the device into a new machine, or make a backup on the booted NCN. Make a snapshot of the USB device.

    ```bash
    mylinuxpc> mount -v /dev/disk/by-label/PITDATA /mnt
    mylinuxpc> tar -czvf --exclude *.squashfs \
    "install-data-$(date  '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').tar.gz" /mnt/
    mylinuxpc> umount -v /dev/disk/by-label/PITDATA
    ```

1. Follow the directions in [Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB](bootstrap_livecd_usb.md), and then return here and move onto the next step.

   The new tar.gz file can be stored anywhere, and can be used to reinitialize the LiveCD.

1. Delete the existing content on the USB device and create a new LiveCD on that same USB device.

   Once the install-data partition is created, it can be remounted and can be used to restore the backup.

    ```bash
    mylinuxpc> mount -v /dev/disk/by-label/PITDATA /mnt
    mylinuxpc> tar -xzvf $(ls -ltR *.tar.gz | head -n 1)
    mylinuxpc> ls -R /mnt
    ```

   The tarball should have extracted everything into the install-data partition.

1. Retrieve the SquashFS artifacts.

   The artifacts can be retrieved at the following locations:

   * `/mnt/var/www/ephemeral/k8s/`
   * `/mnt/var/www/ephemeral/ceph/`

1. Attach the USB to a Cray non-compute node (NCN) and reboot into the USB device.

1. Once booted into the USB device, restore network configuration and dnsmasq, and ensure the pods are started.

   > STOP AND INSPECT ANY FAILURE IN ANY OF THESE COMMANDS

   ```bash
    tar -xzvf /var/www/ephemeral/backup/dnsmasq*.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf /var/www/ephemeral/backup/network*.tar.gz
    systemctl restart wicked wickedd-nanny
    systemctl restart dnsmasq
    systemctl start basecamp nexus
   ```

The LiveCD is now re-installed with the previous configuration.
