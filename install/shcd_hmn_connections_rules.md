## Introduction

The HMN tab of the SHCD describes the air-cooled hardware present in the system and how these devices are connected to the Hardware Management Network (HMN). This information is required by CSM to perform hardware discovery and geolocation of air-cooled hardware in the system. The HMN tab may contain other hardware that is not managed by CSM, but is connected to the HMN. 

The `hmn_connections.json` file is derived from the HMN tab of a system SHCD, and is one of the seed files required by Cray Site Init (CSI) command to generate configuration files required to install CSM. The `hmn_connections.json` file is almost a 1 to 1 copy of the right-hand table in the HMN tab of the SHCD. It is an array of JSON objects, and each object represents a row from the HMN tab. Any row that is not understood by CSI will be ignored, this includes any additional devices connected to the HMN that are not managed by CSM.

The System Layout Service (SLS) contains data about what hardware is in the system and how it is connected to the HMN network. This data is generated when the CSI tool generates configurations files for system. For air-cooled hardware, SLS will contain the SLS representation of the device and a Management Switch Connector object that describes what device is plugged into a particular management switch port.

Column mapping from SHCD to `hmn_connections.json`:

| SHCD Column | SHCD Column Name | hmn_connections Field | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| J20         | Source           | Source                | Name of the device connected to the HMN network |
| K20         | Rack             | SourceRack            | Source Rack, matches regex `x\d+`               |
| L20         | Location         | SourceLocation        | For nodes (Management, Compute, Application), this is bottom most rack slot that the node occupies, and can be extracted by `[a-zA-Z]*(\d+)([a-zA-Z]*)`. For other device types this is ignored. |
| M20         |                  | SourceSubLocation     | For compute nodes, this can be `L`, `l`, `R`, `r`, or blank. For other device types this is ignored. |

| U20         | Port             | DestinationPort       | Switch port on the management switch            |
> Only J20 needs to have the column name of `Source`. There are no requirements on what the other columns should be named.


Some conventions for this document:
* All Source names from the SHCD are lowercased before being processed by the CSI tool.
* Throughout this document the Field names from the `hmn_connections.json` file will be used to referenced values from the SHCD.
* Each device type has an example of how it is represented in the HMN tab of the SHCD, the `hmn_connections.json` file, and lastly in SLS.

<a name="compute-node"></a>
## Compute Node
The Source field needs to match these conditions to be considered a compute node:
* Has the prefix of:
  * `nid`
  * `cn`
* Source field contains ends with an integer that matches this regex: `(\d+$)`
  * This is integer is the Node ID (NID) for the node
  * Each node should have a unique NID value


The following are valid source fields for example:
  - `nid000001`
  - `cn1`
  - `cn-01`

Depending the type of compute node additional rules may apply. Compute nodes in the follow sections will use the `nid` prefix.

### Dense 4 node chassis - Gigabyte or Intel chassis
> Apollo 2000 compute nodes are not currently supported by CSM

Air-cooled compute nodes are typically in a 2U chassis that contains 4 compute nodes. Each of the compute nodes in the chassis gets its own row in the HMN tab, plus a parent row.

The value of the SourceParent field is used to group together the 4 nodes that are contained within the same chassis, and it is used to reference another row in the SHCD HMN table. The referenced SourceParent row is used to determine the rack slot that the compute nodes in occupy.
* The SourceParent row can be a Chassis Management Controller which can be used to control devices underneath it. This device typically will have a connection to the HMN. A Gigabyte CMC is an example of a CMC. If a CMC is not connected to the HMN network, this will prevent CSM services from managing that device.
* The SourceParent row can be a virtual parent that is used to group the compute nodes together symbolically into a chassis. Does not need to not have a connection to the HMN.


The rack slot that a compute node occupies is determined by the Rack Slot of the SourceParent. The SourceLocation of the parent is the bottom most U of the chassis. The xname that is given to the 4 nodes in the same chassis used by the HMS/SLS services specify that all of the computes are in the same rack U (bottommost U of the chassis)

The BMC ordinal for the nodes BMC is derived from the NID of the node, by applying a modulo of 4 plus 1.
For example, the node with NID 17 in slot 10 in cabinet 3000 will have the xname of x3000s10b2n0

#### SHCD
Example 4 compute nodes in the same chassis with a CMC connected to the network. The compute node chassis is located in slot 17 of cabinet 3000, and the compute node BMCs are connected to ports 33-36 in the management leaf switch in slot 14 of cabinet 3000. Port 32 on the leaf switch is for the CMC in the chassis, refer to [Chassis Management Controller](#chassis-management-controller) section for additional details.

### Single node chassis - Apollo 6500 XL675D

A single compute node chassis needs to match these additional conditions:
* No SourceParent defined
* No SourceSubLocation defined

This convention applies to all compute nodes that have a single node in a chassis, such as the Apollo XL675D.

#### SHCD
A single chassis node with NID 1 located in slot 2 of cabinet 3000. The node's BMC is connected to port 36 of the management leaf switch in slot 40 of cabinet 3000.

### Dual node chassis - Apollo 6500 XL645D

Additional matching conditions:
* SourceSubLocation field contains one of: `L`, `l`, `R`, `r`.

In addition to the top-level compute node naming requirements when they are 2 nodes in a single chassis the SourceSubLocation is required. The SourceSubLocation can contain one of the following values: `L`, `l`, `R`, `r`. These values are used to determine the BMC ordinal for the node.
* `L`, `l` translates into the xname having `b1`
  * Such as x3000c0s10b1b0
* `R`, `r` translates into the xname having `b2`
  * Such as x3000c0s10b1b0

This convention applies to all compute nodes that have two nodes in a chassis, such as the Apollo XL645D.

#### SHCD
A compute node chassis with 2 nodes located in slot 8 of cabinet 3000. NID 1 is on the left side of the chassis, and NID 2 is on the right side. The two node BMCs are connected to ports 37 and 38 of the management leaf switch in slot 40 of cabinet 3000.

## Chassis Management Controller (CMC)
> This is not the same as an RCM (Rack Consolidation Module) that is present in Apollo 2000 chassis.

Matching conditions:
* This row is referenced as a SourceParent of another row
* Source field contains `cmc` or `CMC`

A Chassis Management Controller is a device which can be used to BMCs underneath it. This device will typically have a connection to the HMN. A Gigabyte CMC is an example of a CMC. If a CMC is not connected to the HMN network, this will prevent CSM services from managing that device.

These devices will have the BMC ordinal of 999 for their xnames. Such as x3000c0s10b999.

### SHCD
The CMC for the chassis in slot 28 of cabinet 3000 is connected to port 32 of the management leaf switch in slot 22 of cabinet 3000.

## Management Node

<a name="management-node-master"></a>
### Master
The Source field needs to match both of the following conditions:
  * `mn` prefix
  * Integer number immediately after the prefix, can be padded with `0` characters.

The integer number after the prefix is used to determine the hostname of the master node. For example, `mn02` corresponds to host name `ncn-m002`.

Typically, the BMC of the first master node is not connected to the HMN network, as its BMC is connected to the site network.

#### SHCD
Example master node where its BMC is connected to the HMN. The master node is in slot 2 in cabinet 3000, and its BMC is connected to port 25 in the management leaf switch in slot 14 of cabinet 3000.

## Application Node

The Source field needs to match these conditions to be considered an application node:
* Has the prefix of:
  * `uan`
  * `gn`
  * `ln`
  > The naming conventions for application nodes can be unique to a system. Refer to the [application node config procedure](create_application_node_config_yaml.md) for the process to to adding additional Source name prefixes for application nodes.


<a name="application-node-single-node-chassis"></a>
### Single Node Chassis

A single application node chassis needs to match these additional conditions:
* No SourceParent defined
* No SourceSubLocation defined

This convention applies to all application nodes that have a single node in a chassis.


#### SHCD
Example application node is in slot 4 of cabinet 3000, and its BMC is connected to port 25 of management leaf switch in slot 14 of cabinet 3000. 

| Source          | Rack  | Location |     | Parent          |     | Port | Destination | Rack   | Location |     | Port |
| --------------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --------------- | --- | ---- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | --- | ---- | 
| uan01           | x3000 | u04      | -   |                 |     | j3   | sw-smn01    | x3000  | u14      | -   | j25  |

#### HMN Connections

```json
{"Source":"uan01","SourceRack":"x3000","SourceLocation":"u04","DestinationRack":"x3000","DestinationLocation":"u14","DestinationPort":"j25"}
```

#### Building xnames for nodes in a single application node chassis
The xname format for nodes takes the form of `xXcCsSbBnN`:
  - xX: where `X` is the Cabinet or Rack identification number.
  - cC: where `C` is the chassis identification number. This should be `0`.
  - sS: where `S` is the lowest slot the node chassis occupies.
  - bB: where `B` is the ordinal of the node BMC. This should be `0`.
  - nN: where `N` is the ordinal of the node This should be `0`.

For example, if an application node is in slot 4 of cabinet 3000, then it would have `x3000c0s4b0n0` as its xname.  
 
<a name="application-node-dual-node-chassis"></a>
### Dual Node Chassis
Additional matching conditions:

* SourceSubLocation field contains one of: `L`, `l`, `R`, `r`.

In addition to the top-level compute node naming requirements when they are 2 nodes in a single chassis the SourceSubLocation is required. The SourceSubLocation can contain one of the following values: `L`, `l`, `R`, `r`. These values are used to determine the BMC ordinal for the node.
* `L`, `l` translates into the xname having `b1`
  * Such as x3000c0s10b1b0
* `R`, `r` translates into the xname having `b2`
  * Such as x3000c0s10b1b0

This convention applies to all application nodes that have two nodes in a single chassis.

#### SHCD
A application node chassis with 2 nodes located in slot 8 of cabinet 3000. uan01 is on the left side of the chassis, and uan02 is on the right side. The two node BMCs are connected to ports 37 and 38 of the management leaf switch in slot 40 of cabinet 3000.

#### Building xnames for nodes in a dual application node chassis

The xname format for nodes takes the form of `xXcCsSbBnN`:
  - xX: where `X` is the Cabinet or Rack identification number.
  - cC: where `C` is the chassis identification number. This should be `0`.
  - sS: where `S` is the lowest slot the node chassis occupies.
  - bB: where `B` is the ordinal of the node BMC.
    - If the SourceSubLocation is `L` or `l`, then this should be `1`.
    - If the SourceSubLocation is `R` or `r`, then this should be `2`.
  - nN: where `N` is the ordinal of the node This should be `0`.

For example:
  - If an application node is in slot 8 of cabinet 3000 with a SourceSubLocation of `L`, then it would have `x3000c0s8b1n0` as its xname.  
  - If an application node is in slot 8 of cabinet 3000 with a SourceSubLocation of `R`, then it would have `x3000c0s8b2n0` as its xname.
