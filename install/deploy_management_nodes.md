# Deploy Management Nodes

The following procedure deploys Linux and Kubernetes software to the management NCNs.
Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes followed by the master nodes
and worker nodes together.

After the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which
take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand
what happens and when. When the process completes for all nodes, the Ceph storage is
initialized and the Kubernetes cluster is created and ready for a workload. The PIT node
will join Kubernetes after it is rebooted later in
[Redeploy PIT Node](index.md#redeploy_pit_node).

## Timing of deployments

The timing of each set of boots varies based on hardware. Nodes from some manufacturers will
POST faster than others or vary based on BIOS setting. After powering a set of nodes on,
an administrator can expect a healthy boot session to take about 60 minutes depending on
the number of storage and worker nodes.

## 1. Prepare for management node deployment

Preparation of the environment must be done before attempting to deploy the management nodes.

<a name="tokens-and-ipmi-password"></a>

### 1.1 Tokens and IPMI password

1. Define shell environment variables that will simplify later commands to deploy management nodes.

   1. Set `IPMI_PASSWORD` to the root password for the NCN BMCs.

      > `read -s` is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.

      ```bash
      pit# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD
      pit# export IPMI_PASSWORD
      ```

   1. Set the remaining helper variables.

      > These values do not need to be altered from what is shown.

      ```bash
      pit# mtoken='ncn-m(?!001)\w+-mgmt' ; stoken='ncn-s\w+-mgmt' ; wtoken='ncn-w\w+-mgmt' ; export USERNAME=root
      ```

   Throughout the guide, simple one-liners can be used to query status of expected nodes. If the shell or environment is terminated, these
   environment variables should be re-exported.

   Examples:

   * Check power status of all NCNs.

      ```bash
      pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u |
              xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power status
      ```

   * Power off all NCNs.

      ```bash
      pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u |
              xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power off
      ```

<a name="apply-ncn-pre-boot-workarounds"></a>

### 1.2 Apply NCN pre-boot workarounds

_There will be post-boot workarounds as well._

Follow the [workaround instructions](../update_product_stream/index.md#apply-workarounds) for the `before-ncn-boot` breakpoint.

<a name="ensure-time-is-accurate-before-deploying-ncns"></a>

### 1.3 Ensure time is accurate before deploying NCNs

**NOTE:** Optionally, in order to use a timezone other than UTC, instead of step 1 below, follow
[this procedure for setting a local timezone](../operations/node_management/Configure_NTP_on_NCNs.md#set-a-local-timezone). Then
proceed to step 2.

1. Ensure that the PIT node has the correct current time.

   The time can be inaccurate if the system has been powered off for a long time, or, for example, the CMOS was cleared on a Gigabyte node. See [Clear Gigabyte CMOS](clear_gigabyte_cmos.md).

   > **This step should not be skipped.**

   Check the time on the PIT node to see whether it matches the current time:

   ```bash
   pit# date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N%z"
   ```

   If the time is inaccurate, set the time manually.

   ```bash
   pit# timedatectl set-time "2019-11-15 00:00:00"
   ```

   Run the NTP script:

   ```bash
   pit# /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh
   ```

   This ensures that the PIT is configured with an accurate date/time, which will be propagated to the NCNs during boot.

1. Ensure that the current time is set in BIOS for all management NCNs.

   Each NCN is booted to the BIOS menu, the date and time are checked, and set to the current UTC time if needed.

   > **NOTE:** Some steps in this procedure depend on `USERNAME` and `IPMI_PASSWORD` being set. This is done in
[Tokens and IPMI Password](#tokens-and-ipmi-password).

   Repeat the following process for each NCN.

   1. Set the `bmc` variable to the name of the BMC of the NCN being checked.

      **Important:** Be sure to change the below example to the appropriate NCN.

      ```console
      pit# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt
      ```

   1. Start an IPMI console session to the NCN.

      ```console
      pit# conman -j $bmc
      ```

   1. Using another terminal to watch the console, boot the node to BIOS.

      ```console
      pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis bootdev bios &&
           ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power off && sleep 10 &&
           ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power on
      ```

      > For HPE NCNs, the above process will boot the nodes to their BIOS; however, the BIOS menu is unavailable through conman because
      > the node is booted into a graphical BIOS menu.
      >
      > In order to access the serial version of the BIOS menu, perform the `ipmitool` steps above to boot the node.
      > Then, in conman, press `ESC+9` key combination when
      > the following messages are shown on the console. That key combination will open a menu that can be used to enter
      > the BIOS using conman.
      >
      > ```text
      > For access via BIOS Serial Console:
      > Press 'ESC+9' for System Utilities
      > Press 'ESC+0' for Intelligent Provisioning
      > Press 'ESC+!' for One-Time Boot Menu
      > Press 'ESC+@' for Network Boot
      > ```
      >
      > For HPE NCNs, the date configuration menu is at the following path: `System Configuration -> BIOS/Platform Configuration (RBSU) -> Date and Time`.
      >
      > Alternatively, for HPE NCNs, log in to the BMC's web interface and access the HTML5 console for the node, in order to interact with the graphical BIOS.
      > From the administrator's own machine, create an SSH tunnel (`-L` creates the tunnel; `-N` prevents a shell and stubs the connection):
      >
      > ```bash
      > linux# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt # Change this to be the appropriate node
      > linux# ssh -L 9443:$bmc:443 -N root@eniac-ncn-m001
      > ```
      >
      > Opening a web browser to `https://localhost:9443` will give access to the BMC's web interface.

   1. When the node boots, the conman session can be used to see the BIOS menu, in order to check and set the time to current UTC time.
      The process varies depending on the vendor of the NCN.

   1. After the correct time has been verified, power off the NCN.

      ```bash
      pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power off
      ```

   Repeat the above process for each NCN.

<a name="update_management_node_firmware"></a>

## 2. Update management node firmware

> All firmware can be found in the HFP package provided with the Shasta release.

The management nodes are expected to have certain minimum firmware installed for BMC, node BIOS, and PCIe cards.
Where possible, the firmware should be updated prior to install. It is good to meet the minimum NCN
firmware requirement before starting.

   >**Note:** When the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD, it is not possible to use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) to update the
   the firmware because that service has not yet been installed. However, at this point, it would be possible to use
   the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product on the PIT node to learn about the firmware versions available in HFP.

   If the firmware is not updated at this point in the installation workflow, then it can be done with FAS after CSM and HFP have
   both been installed and configured. However, at that point a rolling reboot procedure for the management nodes will be needed,
   after the firmware has been updated.

   See the `Shasta 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000`
   on the [`HPE Customer Support Center`](https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg) for information about the _HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack_ (HFP) product.

   In the HFP documentation there is information about the recommended firmware packages to be installed.
   See "Product Details" in the _HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide_.

   Some of the component types have manual procedures to check firmware versions and update firmware.
   See `Upgrading Firmware Without FAS` in the `HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide`.
   It will be possible to extract the files from the product tarball, but the `install.sh` script from that product
   will be unable to load the firmware versions into the Firmware Action Services (FAS) because the management nodes
   are not booted and running Kubernetes and FAS cannot be used until Kubernetes is running.

   If booted into the PIT node, the firmware can be found with HFP package provided with the Shasta release.

1. (optional) Check these BIOS settings on management nodes [NCN BIOS](../background/ncn_bios.md).

    > This is **optional**, the BIOS settings (or lack thereof) do not prevent deployment. The NCN installation will work with the CMOS' default BIOS. There may be settings that facilitate the speed of deployment, but they may be tuned at a later time.
    >
    > **NOTE:** The BIOS tuning will be automated, further reducing this step.

1. Check for minimum NCN firmware versions and update them as needed,
   The firmware on the management nodes should be checked for compliance with the minimum version required
   and updated, if necessary, at this point.

   > **WARNING:** Gigabyte NCNs running BIOS version C20 can become unusable
   > when Shasta 1.5 is installed. This is a result of a bug in the Gigabyte
   > firmware. This bug has not been observed in BIOS version C17.
   >
   > A key symptom of this bug is that the NCN will not PXE boot and will instead
   > fall through to the boot menu, despite being configure to PXE boot. This
   > behavior will persist until the failing node's CMOS is cleared.

## 3. Deploy management nodes

Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes first, then the master nodes and worker nodes together.
After the operating system boots on each node there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the
console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process is complete
for all nodes, the Ceph storage will have been initialized and the Kubernetes cluster will be created ready for a workload.

<a name="deploy-workflow"></a>

### 3.1 Deploy workflow

The configuration workflow described here is intended to help understand the expected path for booting and configuring. The actual steps to
be performed are in the [Deploy](#deploy) section.

1. Start watching the consoles for `ncn-s001` and at least one other storage node
1. Boot all storage nodes at the same time
    * The first storage node (`ncn-s001`) will boot; it then starts a loop as `ceph-ansible` configuration waits for all other storage nodes to boot.
    * The other storage nodes boot and become passive. They will be fully configured when `ceph-ansible` runs to completion on `ncn-s001`.
1. Once `ncn-s001` notices that all other storage nodes have booted, `ceph-ansible` will begin Ceph configuration. This takes several minutes.
1. Once `ceph-ansible` has finished on `ncn-s001`, then `ncn-s001` waits for `ncn-m002` to create `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`.
1. Start watching the consoles for `ncn-m002`, `ncn-m003`, and at least one worker node.
1. Boot master nodes (`ncn-m002` and `ncn-m003`) and all worker nodes at the same time.
    * The worker nodes will boot and wait for `ncn-m002` to create the `/etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane` file so that they can join Kubernetes.
    * The third master node (`ncn-m003`) boots and waits for `ncn-m002` to create the `/etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane` file so that it can join Kubernetes
    * The second master node (`ncn-m002`) boots and runs `kubernetes-cloudinit.sh`, which will create `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` and
      `/etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plan`. It then waits for the storage node to `create etcd-backup-s3-credentials`.
1. Once `ncn-s001` notices that `ncn-m002` has created `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`, then `ncn-s001` waits for any worker node to become available.
1. As each worker node notices that `ncn-m002` has created `/etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane`, they will join the Kubernetes cluster.
    * Once `ncn-s001` notices that a worker node has done this, it moves forward with the creation of ConfigMaps and running the post-Ceph playbooks
      (S3, OSD pools, quotas, and so on.)
1. Once `ncn-s001` creates `etcd-backup-s3-credentials` during the `ceph-rgw-users` role (one of the last roles after Ceph has been set up), then `ncn-m001`
   notices this and proceeds.

> **NOTE:** If several hours have elapsed between storage and master nodes booting, or if there were issues PXE booting master nodes, the `cloud-init` script on
> `ncn-s001` may not complete successfully. This can cause the `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` on master node(s) to continue to output the following message:
>
> ```text
> [ 1328.351558] cloud-init[8472]: Waiting for storage node to create etcd-backup-s3-credentials secret...
> ```
>
> In this case, the following script is safe to be executed again on `ncn-s001`:
>
> ```ShellSession
> ncn-s001# /srv/cray/scripts/common/storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh
> ```
>
> After this script finishes, the secrets will be created and the `cloud-init` script on the master node(s) should complete.
>

### 3.2 Deploy

1. Change the default root password and SSH keys

   The management nodes deploy with a default password in the image, so it is a recommended best
   practice for system security to change the root password in the image so that it is
   not the documented default password.

   It is **strongly encouraged** to change the default root password and SSH keys in the images used to boot the management nodes.
   Follow the NCN image customization steps in [Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node](../operations/security_and_authentication/Change_NCN_Image_Root_Password_and_SSH_Keys_on_PIT_Node.md)

1. Create boot directories for any NCN in DNS.

    This will create folders for each host in `/var/www`, allowing each host to have its own unique set of artifacts:
    kernel, `initrd`, SquashFS, and `script.ipxe` bootscript.

    ```bash
    pit# /root/bin/set-sqfs-links.sh
    ```

    > Every NCN except for `ncn-m001` should be included in the output from this script. If that is not the case,
    > then verify that all NCN BMCs are set to use DHCP. See
    > [Set node BMCs to DHCP](prepare_management_nodes.md#set_node_bmcs_to_dhcp). After that is done,
    > re-run the `set-sqfs-links.sh` script.

1. Customize boot scripts for any out-of-baseline NCNs
    * **Worker nodes** with more than two small disks need to make adjustments to [prevent bare-metal `etcd` creation](../background/ncn_mounts_and_file_systems.md#worker-nodes-with-etcd).
    * For a brief overview of what is expected, see [disk plan of record / baseline](../background/ncn_mounts_and_file_systems.md#plan-of-record--baseline).

1. <a name="set-uefi-and-power-off"></a>Set each node to always UEFI Network Boot, and ensure they are powered off

    ```bash
    pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} chassis bootdev pxe options=persistent
    pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} chassis bootdev pxe options=efiboot
    pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power off
    ```

    > **NOTE:** The NCN boot order is further explained in [NCN Boot Workflow](../background/ncn_boot_workflow.md).

1. Validate that the LiveCD is ready for installing NCNs.

   Observe the output of the checks and note any failures, then remediate them.

    ```bash
    pit# csi pit validate --livecd-preflight
    ```

    > Notes:
    >
    > * This check sometimes leaves the terminal in a state where input is not echoed to the screen. If this happens, running the `reset` command will correct it.
    > * Ignore any errors about not being able resolve `arti.dev.cray.com`.

1. Print the available consoles.

    ```bash
    pit# conman -q
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    ncn-m001-mgmt
    ncn-m002-mgmt
    ncn-m003-mgmt
    ncn-s001-mgmt
    ncn-s002-mgmt
    ncn-s003-mgmt
    ncn-w001-mgmt
    ncn-w002-mgmt
    ncn-w003-mgmt
    ```

    > **IMPORTANT:** This is the administrator's _last chance_ to run [NCN pre-boot workarounds](#apply-ncn-pre-boot-workarounds) (the `before-ncn-boot` breakpoint).
    >
    > **NOTE:** All console logs are located at `/var/log/conman/console*`

1. <a name="boot-the-storage-nodes"></a>Boot the **Storage Nodes**

    1. Boot all storage nodes except `ncn-s001`:

        ```bash
        pit# grep -oP $stoken /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | grep -v "ncn-s001-" | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power on
        ```

    1. Wait approximately 1 minute.

    1. Boot `ncn-s001`:

        ```bash
        pit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H ncn-s001-mgmt power on
        ```

1. Observe the installation through the console of `ncn-s001-mgmt`.

    ```bash
    pit# conman -j ncn-s001-mgmt
    ```

    From there an administrator can witness console output for the `cloud-init` scripts.

    **NOTE:** Watch the storage node consoles carefully for error messages. If any are seen, consult [Ceph-CSI Troubleshooting](ceph_csi_troubleshooting.md).

    **NOTE:** If the nodes have PXE boot issues (for example, getting PXE errors, or not pulling the `ipxe.efi` binary), see [PXE boot troubleshooting](pxe_boot_troubleshooting.md).

1. <a name="boot-master-and-worker-nodes"></a>Boot the master and worker nodes.

   Wait for storage nodes before booting Kubernetes master nodes and worker nodes.

   **NOTE:** Once all storage nodes are up and the message `...sleeping 5 seconds until /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` appears on `ncn-s001`'s console, it is safe to proceed with booting the **Kubernetes master nodes and worker nodes**

    ```bash
    pit# grep -oP "($mtoken|$wtoken)" /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power on
    ```

1. Stop watching the console from `ncn-s001`.

    Type the ampersand character and then the period character to exit from the conman session on `ncn-s001`.

    ```text
    &.
    pit#
    ```

1. Wait. Observe the installation through `ncn-m002-mgmt`'s console:

    Print the console name:

    ```bash
    pit# conman -q | grep m002
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    ncn-m002-mgmt
    ```

    Then join the console:

    ```bash
    pit# conman -j ncn-m002-mgmt
    ```

    **NOTE:** If the nodes have PXE boot issues (e.g. getting PXE errors, not pulling the ipxe.efi binary) see [PXE boot troubleshooting](pxe_boot_troubleshooting.md)

    **NOTE:** If one of the master nodes seems hung waiting for the storage nodes to create a secret, check the storage node consoles for error messages.
    If any are found, consult [CEPH CSI Troubleshooting](ceph_csi_troubleshooting.md)

1. Wait for the deployment to finish.

    Refer to [timing of deployments](#timing-of-deployments). It should not take more than 60 minutes for the `kubectl get nodes` command to return output indicating
    that all the master nodes and worker nodes (excluding from the PIT node) booted from the LiveCD and are `Ready`.

    ```bash
    pit# ssh ncn-m002
    ncn-m002# kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

### 3.3 Check LVM on Kubernetes NCNs

#### 3.3.1 Run the check

Run the following command on the PIT node to validate that the expected LVM labels are present on disks on the master and worker nodes. When it prompts you for a password, enter the root password for `ncn-m002`.

```bash
pit# /usr/share/doc/csm/install/scripts/check_lvm.sh

SUCCESS: LVM checks passed on all master and worker NCNs
```

If the check succeeds, skip the manual check procedure and recovery steps.

**If the check fails for any nodes, the problem must be resolved before continuing.** See [LVM Check Failure Recovery](#lvm-check-failure-recovery).

<a name="manual-lvm-check-procedure"></a>

#### 3.3.3 Manual LVM check procedure

If needed, the LVM checks can be performed manually on the master and worker nodes.

* Manual check on master nodes:

    ```bash
    ncn-m# blkid -L ETCDLVM
    /dev/sdc
    ```

* Manual check on worker nodes:

    ```bash
    ncn-w# blkid -L CONLIB
    /dev/sdb2
    ncn-w# blkid -L CONRUN
    /dev/sdb1
    ncn-w# blkid -L K8SLET
    /dev/sdb3
    ```

The manual checks are considered successful if all of the `blkid` commands report a disk device (such as `/dev/sdc` -- the particular device is unimportant).
If any of the `lsblk` commands return no output, then the check is a failure. **Any failures must be resolved before continuing.** See the following section
for details on how to do so.

<a name="lvm-check-failure-recovery"></a>

#### 3.3.4 LVM check failure recovery

If there are LVM check failures, then the problem must be resolved before continuing with the install.

* If **any master node** has the problem, then wipe and redeploy **all** of the NCNs before continuing the installation:
    1. Wipe each worker node using the 'Basic Wipe' section of [Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation](wipe_ncn_disks_for_reinstallation.md#basic-wipe).
    1. Wipe each master node (**except** `ncn-m001` because it is the PIT node) using the 'Basic Wipe' section of [Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation](wipe_ncn_disks_for_reinstallation.md#basic-wipe).
    1. Wipe each storage node using the 'Full Wipe' section of [Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation](wipe_ncn_disks_for_reinstallation.md#full-wipe).
    1. Return to the [Set each node to always UEFI Network Boot, and ensure they are powered off](#set-uefi-and-power-off) step of the [Deploy Management Nodes](#deploy_management_nodes) section above.

* If **only worker nodes** have the problem, then wipe and redeploy the affected worker nodes before continuing the installation:
    1. Wipe each affected worker node using the 'Basic Wipe' section of [Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation](wipe_ncn_disks_for_reinstallation.md#basic-wipe).
    1. Power off each affected worker node.
    1. Return to the [Boot the Master and Worker Nodes](#boot-master-and-worker-nodes) step of the [Deploy Management Nodes](#deploy_management_nodes) section above.
        * Note: The `ipmitool` command will give errors trying to power on the unaffected nodes, because they are already powered on -- this is expected and not a problem.

### 3.4 Check for unused drives on utility storage nodes

> **IMPORTANT:** Do the following if NCNs are Gigabyte hardware. It is suggested (but optional) for HPE NCNs.
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Estimate the expected number of OSDs using the following table and using this equation:
>
> `total_osds` = `(number of utility storage/Ceph nodes)` `*` `(OSD count from table below for the appropriate hardware)`

| Hardware Manufacturer | OSD Drive Count (not including OS drives)|
| :-------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |
| GigaByte              | 12 |
| HPE                   | 8  |

#### Option 1

  If there are OSDs on each node (`ceph osd tree` can show this), then all the nodes are in Ceph. That means the orchestrator can be used to look for the devices.

1. Get the number of OSDs in the cluster.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph -f json-pretty osd stat |jq .num_osds
    24
    ```

   **IMPORTANT:** If the returned number of OSDs is equal to `total_osds` calculated, then skip the following steps. If not, then proceed with the below additional checks and remediation steps.

1. Compare the number of OSDs to the output (which should resemble the example below). The number of drives will depend on the server hardware.

    > **NOTE:** If the Ceph cluster is large and has a lot of nodes, a node may be specified after the below command to limit the results.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph orch device ls

    ```

    If there are devices that show `Available` as `Yes` and they are not being automatically added, that device may need to be zapped.

    **IMPORTANT:** Prior to zapping any device, ensure that it is not being used.

1. Check to see if the number of devices is less than the number of listed drives in the output from step 1.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph orch device ls|grep dev|wc -l
    24
    ```

    If the numbers are equal, but less than the `total_osds` calculated, then the `ceph-mgr` daemon may need to be failed in order to get a fresh inventory.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph mgr fail $(ceph mgr dump | jq -r .active_name)
    ```

    Wait 5 minutes and then re-check `ceph orch device ls`. See if the drives are still showing as `Available`. If so, then proceed to the next step.

1. `ssh` to the host and look at `lsblk` output and check against the device from the above `ceph orch device ls`

    ```bash
    ncn-s# lsblk
    NAME                                                                                                 MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE   MOUNTPOINT

    ```

    * If it has an LVM volume like above, then it may be in use. In that case, do the option 2 check below to make sure that the drive can be wiped.

#### Option 2

1. Log into **each** `ncn-s` node and check for unused drives.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# cephadm shell -- ceph-volume inventory
    ```

    **IMPORTANT:** The `cephadm` command may output this warning `WARNING: The same type, major and minor should not be used for multiple devices.`. Ignore this warning.

    The field `available` would be `True` if Ceph sees the drive as empty and can
    be used. For example:

    ```text
    Device Path               Size         rotates available Model name
    /dev/sda                  447.13 GB    False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH480
    /dev/sdb                  447.13 GB    False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH480
    /dev/sdc                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    /dev/sdd                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    /dev/sde                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    /dev/sdf                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    /dev/sdg                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    /dev/sdh                  3.49 TB      False   False     SAMSUNG MZ7LH3T8
    ```

    Alternatively, just dump the paths of available drives:

    ```bash
    ncn-s# cephadm shell -- ceph-volume inventory --format json-pretty | jq -r '.[]|select(.available==true)|.path'
    ```

##### Wipe and add drives

1. Wipe the drive **ONLY after confirming that the drive is not being used by the current Ceph cluster** using options 1, 2, or both.

    > The following example wipes drive `/dev/sdc` on `ncn-s002`. Replace these values with the appropriate ones for the situation.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph orch device zap ncn-s002 /dev/sdc --force
    ```

1. Add unused drives.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# cephadm shell -- ceph-volume lvm create --data /dev/sd<drive to add> --bluestore
    ```

More information can be found at [the `cephadm` reference page](../operations/utility_storage/Cephadm_Reference_Material.md).

## 4. Configure after management node deployment

After the management nodes have been deployed, configuration can be applied to the booted nodes.

<a name="livecd-cluster-authentication"></a>

### 4.1 LiveCD cluster authentication

The LiveCD needs to authenticate with the cluster to facilitate the rest of the CSM installation.

1. Determine which master node is the first master node.

   Most often the first master node will be `ncn-m002`.

   Run the following commands on the PIT node to extract the value of the `first-master-hostname` field from the `/var/www/ephemeral/configs/data.json` file:

   ```bash
   pit# FM=$(cat /var/www/ephemeral/configs/data.json | jq -r '."Global"."meta-data"."first-master-hostname"')
   pit# echo $FM
   ```

1. Copy the Kubernetes configuration file from that node to the LiveCD to be able to use `kubectl` as cluster administrator.

   Run the following commands on the PIT node:

   ```bash
   pit# mkdir -v ~/.kube
   pit# scp ${FM}.nmn:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config
   ```

1. Validate that `kubectl` commands run successfully from the PIT node.

    ```bash
    pit# kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                                                  KERNEL-VERSION         CONTAINER-RUNTIME

    ```

<a name="bgp-routing"></a>

### 4.2 BGP Routing

After the NCNs are booted, the BGP peers will need to be checked and updated if the neighbor IP addresses are incorrect on the switches. Follow the steps
below and see [Update BGP Neighbors](../operations/network/metallb_bgp/Update_BGP_Neighbors.md) for more details on the BGP configuration.

**IMPORTANT:** If the management switches are using the CANU-generated configuration for CSM 1.0 (the `CSM 1.2 Preconfig`), then this procedure should be skipped.

1. To check if the management switches are using the CANU-generated configuration for CSM 1.0 (the `CSM 1.2 Preconfig`) log in to both spine switches and
   see if a login banner exists. It should look similar to the examples below.

    The CSM version must be 1.0, and CANU should be present showing a version. An accurate login banner for Mellanox and Aruba will look similar to the following examples:

    * Mellanox Example:

        ```ShellSession
        ncn-m001# ssh admin@sw-spine-001
        NVIDIA Onyx Switch Management
        Password:
        Last login: Sat Feb 26 00:10:26 UTC 2022 from 10.252.1.5 on pts/0
        Number of total successful connections since last 1 days: 89

        ###############################################################################
        # CSM version:  1.0
        # CANU version: 1.1.11
        ###############################################################################
        ```

    * Aruba Example:

        ```ShellSession
        ncn-m001# ssh admin@sw-spine-001
        ###############################################################################
        # CSM version:  1.0
        # CANU version: 1.1.11
        ###############################################################################
        ```

2. Make sure the `SYSTEM_NAME` variable is set to name of your system.

    ```bash
    pit# export SYSTEM_NAME=eniac
    ```

3. Determine the IP addresses of the worker NCNs.

    ```bash
    pit# grep -B1 "name: ncn-w" /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/networks/NMN.yaml
    ```

4. Determine the IP addresses of the switches that are peering.

    ```bash
    pit# grep peer-address /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/metallb.yaml
    ```

5. Run the script appropriate for your switch hardware vendor.

    * If you have Mellanox switches, run the BGP helper script.

        The BGP helper script requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of switch 2, and the path to the to CSI-generated network files.

        * The IP addresses used should be Node Management Network (NMN) IP addresses. These IP addresses will be used for the BGP Router-ID.
        * The path to the CSI-generated network files must include `CAN.yaml`, `HMN.yaml`, `HMNLB.yaml`, `NMNLB.yaml`, and `NMN.yaml`. The path must include the `SYSTEM_NAME`.

        The IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches.

        ```bash
        pit# /usr/local/bin/mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py 10.252.0.2 10.252.0.3 /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/networks/
        ```

       `*WARNING*` The `mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py` script assumes that the prefix length of the CAN is `/24`. If that value is incorrect for the
       system being installed then update the script with the correct prefix length by editing the following line:

       ```python
       cmd_prefix_list_can = "ip prefix-list pl-can seq 30 permit {} /24 ge 24".format()
       ```

    * If you have Aruba switches, run CANU.

        CANU requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of switch 2, and the path to the to directory containing the file `sls_input_file.json`.

        The IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches.

        ```bash
        pit# canu -s 1.5 config bgp --ips 10.252.0.2,10.252.0.3 --csi-folder /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/
        ```

6. Do the following steps **for each of the switch IP addresses that you found previously**.

    1. Log in to the switch as the `admin` user:

        ```bash
        pit# ssh admin@<switch_ip_address>
        ```

    2. Check the status of the BGP peering sessions
        * Aruba: `show bgp ipv4 unicast summary`
        * Mellanox: `show ip bgp summary`

        You should see a neighbor for each of the workers NCN IP addresses found above. If it is an Aruba switch, you will also see a neighbor for the other switch of the pair that are peering.

        At this point the peering sessions with the worker IP addresses should be in `IDLE`, `CONNECT`, or `ACTIVE` state (not `ESTABLISHED`). This is because the MetalLB speaker pods are not deployed yet.

        You should see that the `MsgRcvd` and `MsgSent` columns for the worker IP addresses are 0.

    3. Check the BGP configuration to verify that the NCN neighbors are configured as passive.
        * Aruba: `show run bgp` The passive neighbor configuration is required. `neighbor 10.252.1.7 passive`

            EXAMPLE ONLY

            ```text
            sw-spine-001# show run bgp
            router bgp 65533
            bgp router-id 10.252.0.2
            maximum-paths 8
            distance bgp 20 70
            neighbor 10.252.0.3 remote-as 65533
            neighbor 10.252.1.7 remote-as 65533
            neighbor 10.252.1.7 passive
            neighbor 10.252.1.8 remote-as 65533
            neighbor 10.252.1.8 passive
            neighbor 10.252.1.9 remote-as 65533
            neighbor 10.252.1.9 passive
            ```

        * Mellanox: `show run protocol bgp` The passive neighbor configuration is required. `router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.7 transport connection-mode passive`

            EXAMPLE ONLY

            ```text
            protocol bgp
            router bgp 65533 vrf default
            router bgp 65533 vrf default router-id 10.252.0.2 force
            router bgp 65533 vrf default maximum-paths ibgp 32
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.7 remote-as 65533
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.7 route-map ncn-w003
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.8 remote-as 65533
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.8 route-map ncn-w002
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.9 remote-as 65533
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.9 route-map ncn-w001
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.7 transport connection-mode passive
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.8 transport connection-mode passive
            router bgp 65533 vrf default neighbor 10.252.1.9 transport connection-mode passive
            ```

    4. Repeat the previous steps for the remaining switch IP addresses.

### 4.3 Install tests and test server on NCNs

Run the following commands on the PIT node.

```bash
pit# export CSM_RELEASE=csm-x.y.z
pit# pushd /var/www/ephemeral && ${CSM_RELEASE}/lib/install-goss-tests.sh && popd
```

<a name="remove-default-ntp-pool"></a>

### 4.4 Remove the default NTP pool

Run the following command on the PIT node to remove the default pool, which can cause contention issues with NTP. When it prompts you for a password, enter the root password for `ncn-m002`.

```bash
pit# ssh ncn-m002 "\
        PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' \
        pdsh -b -S -w $(grep -oP 'ncn-\w\d+' /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf |
            grep -v m001 | sort -u |  tr -t '\n' ,) \
        sed -i \'s/^! pool pool[.]ntp[.]org.*//\' /etc/chrony.conf"
```

Expected output looks similar to the following:

```text
Password:
ncn-m002: Warning: Permanently added 'ncn-m002,10.252.1.11' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
ncn-s001: Warning: Permanently added 'ncn-s001,10.252.1.6' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
ncn-s002: Warning: Permanently added 'ncn-s002,10.252.1.5' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

ncn-w002: Warning: Permanently added 'ncn-w002,10.252.1.8' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
ncn-w001: Warning: Permanently added 'ncn-w001,10.252.1.9' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

## 5. Validate management node deployment

Do all of the validation steps. The optional validation steps are manual steps which could be skipped.

<a name="validation"></a>

### 5.1 Validation

The following `csi pit validate` commands will run a series of remote tests on the other nodes to validate they are healthy and configured correctly.

Observe the output of the checks and note any failures, then remediate them.

1. Check the storage nodes.

   ```bash
   pit# csi pit validate --ceph | tee csi-pit-validate-ceph.log
   ```

   Once that command has finished, the following will extract the test totals reported for each node:

   ```bash
   pit# grep "Total Test" csi-pit-validate-ceph.log
   ```

   Example output for a system with three storage nodes:

   ```text
   Total Tests: 8, Total Passed: 8, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 74.3782 seconds
   Total Tests: 3, Total Passed: 3, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.6091 seconds
   Total Tests: 3, Total Passed: 3, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.6260 seconds
   ```

   If these total lines report any failed tests, then look through the full output of the test in `csi-pit-validate-ceph.log` to see which node had the failed test and what the details are for that test.

   **Note:** See [Utility Storage](../operations/utility_storage/Utility_Storage.md) in order to help resolve any failed tests.

1. Check the master and worker nodes.

   **Note:** Throughout the output of the `csi pit validate` command are test totals for each node where the tests run. **Be sure to check
   all of them and not just the final one.** A `grep` command is provided to help with this.

   ```bash
   pit# csi pit validate --k8s | tee csi-pit-validate-k8s.log
   ```

   Once that command has finished, the following will extract the test totals reported for each node:

   ```bash
   pit# grep "Total Test" csi-pit-validate-k8s.log
   ```

   Example output for a system with five master and worker nodes (excluding the PIT node):

   ```text
   Total Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3072 seconds
   Total Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2727 seconds
   Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2841 seconds
   Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3622 seconds
   Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2353 seconds
   ```

   If these total lines report any failed tests, then look through the full output of the test in `csi-pit-validate-k8s.log` to see which node had the failed test and what the details are for that test.

   > **WARNING:** If there are failures for tests with names like `Worker Node CONLIB FS Label`, then manual tests should be run on the node which reported the failure.
   See [Manual LVM Check Procedure](#manual-lvm-check-procedure). If the manual tests fail, then the problem must be resolved before continuing to the next step. See
   [LVM Check Failure Recovery](#lvm-check-failure-recovery).

1. Ensure that weave has not split-brained

   To ensure that weave is operating as a single cluster, run the following command on each member of the Kubernetes cluster (master nodes and worker nodes but **not the PIT node**):

   ```bash
   ncn# weave --local status connections | grep failed
   ```

   If the check is successful, there will be no output. If messages like `IP allocation was seeded by different peers` are seen, then `weave` appears to be split-brained.
   At this point, it is necessary to wipe the NCNs and start the PXE boot again:

   1. Wipe the NCNs using the 'Basic Wipe' section of [Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation](wipe_ncn_disks_for_reinstallation.md).
   1. Return to the 'Boot the **Storage Nodes**' step of [Deploy Management Nodes](#deploy_management_nodes) section above.

<a name="optional-validation"></a>

### 5.2 Optional validation

   1. Verify that all the pods in the `kube-system` namespace are `Running` or `Completed`.

      Run the following command on any Kubernetes master or worker node, or the PIT node:

      ```bash
      ncn-mw/pit# kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system | grep -Ev '(Running|Completed)'
      ```

      If any pods are listed by this command, it means they are not in the `Running` or `Completed` state. That needs to be investigated before proceeding.

   1. Verify that the `ceph-csi` requirements are in place.

      See [Ceph CSI Troubleshooting](ceph_csi_troubleshooting.md) for details.

<a name="important-checkpoint"></a>

## Important checkpoint

Before proceeding, be aware that this is the last point where the other NCN nodes can be rebuilt without also having to rebuild the PIT node. Therefore, take time to double check both the cluster and the validation test results

<a name="next-topic"></a>

## Next topic

After completing the deployment of the management nodes, the next step is to install the CSM services.

See [Install CSM Services](index.md#install_csm_services).
