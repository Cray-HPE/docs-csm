# Prepare `site init`

These procedures guide administrators through setting up the `site-init`
directory which contains important customizations for various products.

1. [Background](#1-background)
1. [Create and Initialize `site-init` Directory](#2-create-and-initialize-site-init-directory)
1. [Create Baseline System Customizations](#3-create-baseline-system-customizations)
    1. [Setup LDAP configuration](#setup-ldap-configuration)
    1. [End of LDAP configuration](#end-of-ldap-configuration)
1. [Customer-Specific Customizations](#4-customer-specific-customizations)

## 1. Background

The `shasta-cfg` directory included in the CSM release tarball includes relatively static,
installation-centric artifacts, such as:

- Cluster-wide network configuration settings required by Helm charts deployed by product stream Loftsman manifests
- [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
- Sealed Secret Generate Blocks -- a form of plain-text input that renders to a Sealed Secret
- Helm chart value overrides that are merged into Loftsman manifests by product stream installers

## 2. Create and initialize `site-init` directory

> **`NOTE`** If the pre-installation is resuming here, ensure the environment variables have been properly set
> by following [Set reusable environment variables](pre-installation.md#15-set-reusable-environment-variables) and then coming back
> to this page.

1. (`pit#`) Set the `SITE_INIT` variable.

    > **Important:** All procedures on this page assume that `SITE_INIT` variable has been set.

    ```bash
    SITE_INIT="${PITDATA}/prep/site-init"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Create the `site-init` directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir -pv "${SITE_INIT}"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Initialize `site-init` from CSM.

    ```bash
    "${CSM_PATH}/shasta-cfg/meta/init.sh" "${SITE_INIT}"
    ```

### 3. Create Baseline System Customizations

The following steps update `${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml`
with system-specific customizations.

1. (`pit#`) Change into the `site-init` directory

    ```bash
    cd "${SITE_INIT}"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Merge the system-specific settings generated by CSI into
    `customizations.yaml`.

    ```bash
    yq merge -xP -i "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" <(yq prefix -P "${PITDATA}/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/customizations.yaml" spec)
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Set the cluster name.

    ```bash
    yq write -i "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" spec.wlm.cluster_name "${SYSTEM_NAME}"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Make a backup copy of `${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml`.

    ```bash
    cp -pv "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml.prepassword"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Review the configuration to generate these sealed secrets in `customizations.yaml` in the `site-init` directory:

    - `spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials`
    - `spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_meds_credentials`
    - `spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_hms_rts_credentials`
    - Replace the `Username` and `Password` references in match the existing settings of your system hardware components.

    > **`NOTE`**
    >
    > - The `cray_reds_credentials` are used by the River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) for River components.
    > - The `cray_meds_credentials` are used by the Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) for the liquid-cooled components in an Olympus (Mountain) cabinet.
    > - The `cray_hms_rts_credentials` are used by the Redfish Translation Service (RTS) for any hardware components which are not managed by Redfish, such as a ServerTech PDU in a River Cabinet.
    >
    > See the `Decrypt Sealed Secrets for Review` section of [Manage Sealed Secrets](../operations/security_and_authentication/Manage_Sealed_Secrets.md#decrypt-sealed-secrets-for-review),
    > if needing to examine credentials from prior installations.

    ```bash
    vim "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml"
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Review the changes that you made.

    ```bash
    diff ${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml ${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml.prepassword
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Validate that REDS/MEDS/RTS credentials are correct.

    For all credentials, make sure that `Username` and `Password` values are correct.

    - Validate REDS credentials:

        > **`NOTE`** These credentials are used by the REDS and HMS discovery services, targeting River Redfish
        BMC endpoints and management switches
        >
        > - For `vault_redfish_defaults`, the only entry used is:
        >
        >     ```json
        >     {"Cray": {"Username": "root", "Password": "XXXX"}
        >     ```
        >
        > - Ensure the `Cray` key exists. This key is not used in any of the other credential specifications.

        ```bash
        yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" 'spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials.generate.data[*].args.value' | jq
        ```

    - Validate MEDS credentials:

        These credentials are used by the MEDS service, targeting Redfish BMC endpoints.

        ```bash
        yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" 'spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_meds_credentials.generate.data[0].args.value' | jq
        ```

    - Validate RTS credentials:

        These credentials are used by the Redfish Translation Service, targeting River Redfish BMC endpoints and PDU controllers.

        ```bash
        yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" 'spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_hms_rts_credentials.generate.data[*].args.value' | jq
        ```

1. To customize the PKI Certificate Authority (CA) used by the platform, see
    [Certificate Authority](../background/certificate_authority.md).

    > **`IMPORTANT`** The CA may not be modified after install.

#### Setup LDAP configuration

> **`NOTE`** Skip past LDAP configuration to [here](#end-of-ldap-configuration) if there is no LDAP configuration at this time. If LDAP should be enabled later,
> follow [Add LDAP User Federation](../operations/security_and_authentication/Add_LDAP_User_Federation.md) after installation.

1. (`pit#`) Set environment variables for the LDAP server and its port.

   In the example below, the LDAP server has the hostname `dcldap2.us.cray.com` and is using the port 636.

   ```bash
   LDAP=dcldap2.us.cray.com
   PORT=636
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Load the `openjdk` container image.

   > **`NOTE`** Requires a properly configured Docker or Podman
   > environment.

   ```bash
   "${CSM_PATH}/hack/load-container-image.sh" artifactory.algol60.net/csm-docker/stable/docker.io/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Get the issuer certificate.

    Retrieve the issuer certificate for the LDAP server at port 636. Use `openssl s_client` to connect
    and show the certificate chain returned by the LDAP host:

    ```bash
    openssl s_client -showcerts -connect "${LDAP}:${PORT}" </dev/null
    ```

1. Enter the issuer's certificate into `cacert.pem`.

    Either manually extract (i.e., cut/paste) the issuer's
    certificate into `cacert.pem`, or try the following commands to
    create it automatically.

    > **`NOTE`** The following commands were verified using OpenSSL
    > version `1.1.1d` and use the `-nameopt RFC2253` option to ensure
    > consistent formatting of distinguished names.
    > Unfortunately, older versions of OpenSSL may not support
    > `-nameopt` on the `s_client` command or may use a different
    > default format. However,
    > the issuer certificate can be manually extracted
    > from the output of the above `openssl s_client` example, if the
    > following commands are unsuccessful.

    1. (`pit#`) Observe the issuer's DN.

        ```bash
        openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect "${LDAP}:${PORT}" </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep issuer= | sed -e 's/^issuer=//'
        ```

        Expected output includes a line similar to one of the below examples:

        Self-signed Certificate:

        ```text
        emailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US
        ```

        Signed Certificate:

        ```text
         CN=DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1,O=DigiCert Inc,C=US
         ```

    1. (`pit#`) Extract the issuer's certificate.

        > **`NOTE`** The issuer DN is properly escaped as part of the
        > `awk` pattern below. It must be changed to match the value
        > for `emailAddress`, `CN`, `OU`, etc. for your LDAP. If the value
        > you are using is different, be sure to escape it properly!

        ```bash
        openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect "${LDAP}:${PORT}" </dev/null 2>/dev/null |
                  awk '/s:emailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC\/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US/,/END CERTIFICATE/' |
                  awk '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/' > cacert.pem
        ```

1. (`pit#`) Create `certs.jks`.

    > **`NOTE`** The alias used in this command for `cray-data-center-ca` should be changed to match your LDAP.

    ```bash
    podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" \
            artifactory.algol60.net/csm-docker/stable/docker.io/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim keytool \
            -importcert -trustcacerts -file /data/cacert.pem -alias cray-data-center-ca \
            -keystore /data/certs.jks -storepass password -noprompt
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Create `certs.jks.b64` by base-64 encoding `certs.jks`.

    ```bash
    base64 certs.jks > certs.jks.b64
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Inject and encrypt `certs.jks.b64` into `customizations.yaml`.

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | yq w - 'data."certs.jks"' "$(<certs.jks.b64)" | \
        yq r -j - | ${SITE_INIT}/utils/secrets-encrypt.sh | \
        yq w -f - -i ${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray-keycloak'
    {
      "kind": "Secret",
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "keycloak-certs",
        "namespace": "services",
        "creationTimestamp": null
      },
      "data": {}
    }
    EOF
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Update the `keycloak_users_localize` sealed secret with the
    appropriate value for `ldap_connection_url`.

    1. (`pit#`) Set `ldap_connection_url` in `customizations.yaml`.

       ```bash
       yq write -i "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" \
                'spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.keycloak_users_localize.generate.data.(args.name==ldap_connection_url).args.value' \
                "ldaps://${LDAP}"
       ```

    1. (`pit#`) Review the `keycloak_users_localize` sealed secret.

       ```bash
       yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.keycloak_users_localize
       ```

1. Configure the `ldapSearchBase` and `localRoleAssignments` settings for
    the `cray-keycloak-users-localize` chart in `customizations.yaml`.

    > **`NOTE`** There may be one or more groups in LDAP for admins and one or more for users.
    > Each admin group needs to be assigned to role `admin` and set to both `shasta` and `cray` clients in Keycloak.
    > Each user group needs to be assigned to role `user` and set to both `shasta` and `cray` clients in Keycloak.

    1. (`pit#`) Set `ldapSearchBase` in `customizations.yaml`.

       > **`NOTE`** This example sets `ldapSearchBase` to `dc=dcldap,dc=dit`

       ```bash
       yq write -i "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" spec.kubernetes.services.cray-keycloak-users-localize.ldapSearchBase 'dc=dcldap,dc=dit'
       ```

    1. (`pit#`) Set `localRoleAssignments` in `customizations.yaml`.

       > **`NOTE`** This example sets `localRoleAssignments` for the LDAP groups `employee`,
       > `craydev`, and `shasta_admins` to be the `admin` role, and the LDAP group `shasta_users`
       > to be the `user` role.

       ```bash
       yq write -s - -i "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" <<EOF
       - command: update
         path: spec.kubernetes.services.cray-keycloak-users-localize.localRoleAssignments
         value:
         - {"group": "employee", "role": "admin", "client": "shasta"}
         - {"group": "employee", "role": "admin", "client": "cray"}
         - {"group": "craydev", "role": "admin", "client": "shasta"}
         - {"group": "craydev", "role": "admin", "client": "cray"}
         - {"group": "shasta_admins", "role": "admin", "client": "shasta"}
         - {"group": "shasta_admins", "role": "admin", "client": "cray"}
         - {"group": "shasta_users", "role": "user", "client": "shasta"}
         - {"group": "shasta_users", "role": "user", "client": "cray"}
       EOF
       ```

    1. (`pit#`) Review the `cray-keycloak-users-localize` values.

       ```bash
       yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" spec.kubernetes.services.cray-keycloak-users-localize
       ```

#### End of LDAP configuration

1. (`pit#`) Configure the Unbound DNS resolver (if needed).

    > **Important** If access to a site DNS server is required **and** this DNS server was specified to `csi` using the `site-dns`
    > option (either on the command line or in the `system_config.yaml` file),
    > **then no further action is required and this step should be skipped**.

    The default configuration is as follows:

    ```yaml
    cray-dns-unbound:
        domain_name: '{{ network.dns.external }}'
        forwardZones:
          - name: "."
            forwardIps:
              - "{{ network.netstaticips.system_to_site_lookups }}"
    ```

    The configured site DNS server can be verified by inspecting the value set for `system_to_site_lookups`.

    ```bash
    yq r ${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml spec.network.netstaticips.system_to_site_lookups
    ```

    Possible output:

    ```text
    172.30.84.40
    ```

    If there is **no requirement to resolve external hostnames (including other services on the site network) or no upstream DNS server**,
    then the `cray-dns-unbound` service should be configured to forward to the `cray-dns-powerdns` service.

    1. (`pit#`) Update the `forwardZones` configuration for the `cray-dns-unbound` service to point to the `cray-dns-powerdns` service.

        ```bash
        yq write -s - -i ${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml <<EOF
        - command: update
          path: spec.kubernetes.services.cray-dns-unbound.forwardZones
          value:
          - name: "."
            forwardIps:
            - "10.92.100.85"
        EOF
        ```

    1. (`pit#`) Review the `cray-dns-unbound` values.

        > **`IMPORTANT`** **Do not** remove the `domain_name` entry, it is required for Unbound to forward requests to PowerDNS correctly.

        ```bash
        yq read "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" spec.kubernetes.services.cray-dns-unbound
        ```

        Expected output:

        ```yaml
        domain_name: '{{ network.dns.external }}'
        forwardZones:
          - name: "."
            forwardIps:
              - "10.92.100.85"
        ```

    See the following documentation regarding known issues when operating with no upstream DNS server.
    - [Spire Database Cluster DNS Lookup Failure](../troubleshooting/known_issues/spire_database_lookup_error.md)
    - [Spire database connection pool configuration in an air-gapped environment](../troubleshooting/known_issues/spire_database_airgap_configuration.md)

1. (Optional) Configure PowerDNS zone transfer and DNSSEC. See the [PowerDNS Configuration Guide](../operations/network/dns/PowerDNS_Configuration.md) for more information.

   - If zone transfer is to be configured, then review `customizations.yaml` and ensure that the `primary_server`, `secondary_servers`, and `notify_zones` values are set correctly.

   - If DNSSEC is to be used, then add the desired keys into the `dnssec` SealedSecret.

1. Configure Prometheus SNMP Exporter.

   The Prometheus SNMP exporter needs to be configured with a list of management network switches to scrape metrics from in
   order to populate the System Health Service Grafana dashboards.

   > ***NOTE*** that for the Prometheus SNMP exporter to work, SNMP needs to be configured on the management switches
   and the username and password need to match both Vault and the matching sealed secret in customizations.yaml. See
   the [Prometheus SNMP Exporter](../operations/network/management_network/snmp_exporter_configs.md) page for more
   information and review the
   [Adding SNMP Credentials to the System](../operations/network/management_network/snmp_exporter_configs.md#adding-snmp-credentials-to-the-system)
   section for links to the relevant procedures.

1. (`pit#`) Load the `zeromq` container image required by Sealed Secret Generators.

    > **`NOTE`** Requires a properly configured Docker or Podman environment.

    ```bash
    "${CSM_PATH}/hack/load-container-image.sh" artifactory.algol60.net/csm-docker/stable/docker.io/zeromq/zeromq:v4.0.5
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Re-encrypt existing secrets.

    ```bash
    "${SITE_INIT}/utils/secrets-reencrypt.sh" \
        "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml" \
        "${SITE_INIT}/certs/sealed_secrets.key" \
        "${SITE_INIT}/certs/sealed_secrets.crt"
    ```

    It is not an error if this script gives no output.

1. (`pit#`) Generate secrets.

    ```bash
    "${SITE_INIT}/utils/secrets-seed-customizations.s"h "${SITE_INIT}/customizations.yaml"
    ```

1. Leave the `site-init` directory.

    ```bash
    cd "${PITDATA}"
    ```

1. `site-init` is now prepared. Resume [Initialize the LiveCD](pre-installation.md#36-initialize-the-livecd).

## 4. Customer-specific customizations

Customer-specific customizations are any changes on top of the baseline
configuration to satisfy customer-specific requirements. It is recommended that
customer-specific customizations be tracked on branches separate from the
mainline in order to make them easier to manage.

Apply any customer-specific customizations by merging the corresponding
branches into `master` branch of `site-init`.

When considering merges, and especially when resolving conflicts, carefully
examine differences to ensure all changes are relevant. For example, when
applying a customer-specific customization used in a prior version, be sure the
change still makes sense. It is common for options to change as new features are
introduced and bugs are fixed.
