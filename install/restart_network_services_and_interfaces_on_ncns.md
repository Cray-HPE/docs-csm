# Restart Network Services and Interfaces on NCNs

Interfaces within the network stack can be reloaded or reset to fix wedged interfaces.
The NCNs have network device names set during first boot. The names vary based on the
available hardware. For more information, see [NCN Networking](../background/ncn_networking.md).
Any process covered on this page will be covered by the installer.

The use cases for resetting services:

   * Interfaces not showing up
   * IP Addresses not applying
   * Member/children interfaces not being included

   * [Command Reference](#command_reference)
      * Check interface status (up/down/broken)
      * Show routing and status for all devices
      * Print real devices ( ignore no-device )
      * Show the currently enabled network service (Wicked or Network Manager)

### Restart Network Services

There are a few daemons that make up the SUSE network stack. The following are
sorted by safest to touch relative to keeping an SSH connection up.

1. `wickedd.service`: The daemons handling each interface. Resetting this clears stale configuration.
    This command restarts the `wickedd` service without reconfiguring the network interfaces.

    ```bash
    ncn# systemctl restart wickedd
    ```

2. `wicked.service`: The overarching service for spawning daemons and manipulating interface configuration.
    Resetting this reloads daemons and configuration.
    This command restarts the `wicked` service which will respawns daemons and reconfigure the network.

    ```bash
    ncn# systemctl restart wicked
    ```

3. `network.service`: Responsible for network configuration per interface; This does not reload `wicked`.
    This command restarts the network interface configuration, but leaves wicked daemons alone.

    > **NOTE:** Commonly the problem exists within `wicked`. This is a last resort in the event the
    configuration is so bad `wicked` cannot handle it.

    ```bash
    # Restart the network interface configuration, but leaves wicked daemons alone.
    ncn# systemctl restart network
    ```

### Command Reference

* Check interface status (up/down/broken):

   ```bash
   ncn# wicked ifstatus
   ```

* Show routing and status for all devices:

   ```bash
   ncn# wicked ifstatus --verbose all

* Print real devices (ignore no-device):

   ```bash
   ncn# wicked show --verbose all
   ```

* Show the currently enabled network service (Wicked or Network Manager):

   ```bash
   ncn# systemctl show -p Id network.service
   Id=wicked.service
   ```
