## Introduction

This document describes how to interpret the results of the HMS Health Check scripts and techniques for troubleshooting when failures occur.

## Prerequisites

The HMS health checks will not fail if the Cray CLI is not configured. However, some of the troubleshooting suggestions for investigating test failures
involve using the CLI. For information on configuring the Cray CLI, see [Cray command line interface](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#0-cray-command-line-interface).

## Overview

The HMS CT tests are API tests intended to verify that HMS services are installed, operational, and behave as expected. There are two types of CT tests for HMS
services: smoke and functional. Both are executed via Helm test jobs that are defined in the Helm chart for the service that they test. The CT smoke and functional
tests are invoked using the `helm test` command on worker or master NCNs (if applicable). Administrators execute the HMS CT tests using a script called
`run_hms_ct_tests.sh` as part of the CSM health validation procedures.

The CT smoke tests are basic API tests that make calls to HMS service APIs and verify that the expected status codes are returned. They run first for each service
and are useful for verifying that HMS services are installed and responsive. These tests will fail if the service being tested is not installed, unhealthy,
or unresponsive.

The CT functional tests are more rigorous API tests that inspect the response bodies and verify that the fields, values, and form of the data returned are as expected.
They run after the smoke tests and verify that HMS service APIs behave correctly and in accordance with their API specification. They also detect issues that prevent
the proper management or expected use of hardware in the system.

## Execution

The `run_hms_ct_tests.sh` script executes the HMS CT tests in parallel. It waits for each Helm test job to complete, logs the results in a file for the test run, and
prints a summary of the results. The script returns a status code of zero if all tests pass and non-zero if there are one or more failures.

These tests may be executed on any one worker or master NCN (but **not** `ncn-m001` if it is still the PIT node).

### Test all HMS services

(`ncn-mw#`) Run the HMS CT tests by executing the following command:

```bash
/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/run_hms_ct_tests.sh
```

### Test specific HMS service

(`ncn-mw#`) After remediating a test failure for a particular service, just the tests for that individual service
can be re-run by supplying the name of the service to the `run_hms_ct_tests.sh` script with the `-t` option:

```bash
/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/run_hms_ct_tests.sh -t <service>
```

(`ncn-mw#`) To list the HMS services that can be tested, use the `-l` option:

```bash
/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/run_hms_ct_tests.sh -l
```

### Example output

Example output:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
SUCCESS: All 9 service tests passed: bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, hsm, scsd, sls
```

The following is example output reporting a single service failure:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
FAILURE: 1 service test FAILED (hsm), 8 passed (bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, scsd, sls)
For troubleshooting and manual steps, see: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/troubleshooting/hms_ct_manual_run.md
```

The following is an example output reporting multiple service failures:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
FAILURE: All 9 service tests FAILED: bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, hsm, scsd, sls
For troubleshooting and manual steps, see: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/troubleshooting/hms_ct_manual_run.md
```

## Failure analysis

If one or more service tests fail, the log file for the run should be inspected to determine which test job(s) failed.

### Smoke test failure

The following is an example section of a log file reporting a smoke test failure:

```text
NAME: cray-hms-smd
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jun 16 15:46:10 2022
NAMESPACE: services

Last Completed: Fri Jul  1 21:14:25 2022
Phase:          Failed
```

In this case, the HSM smoke test job failed. Find the name of the pod and inspect its logs to determine the cause of the failure.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Find the name of the pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods | grep -E "smd|NAME"
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Show its logs.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs cray-hms-smd-test-smoke-2npqz smoke
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

## Tavern output

Tavern is a `pytest`-based API testing framework. The CT functional tests consist of Tavern tests for HMS services that are written in YAML and are executed via Helm test
jobs. This section describes the output format of Tavern and where to look when investigating functional test failures.

First, a summary of the test suites executed and their results is printed:

```text

```

When test failures occur, additional output is printed below the summary table that includes the following:

- The `Source test stage` that was executing when the failure occurred. This is a portion of the source code for the failed test case.
- The `Formatted stage` that was executing when the failure occurred. This is a portion of the source code for the failed test case with its variables filled in with
  the values that were set at the time of the failure. This includes the request header, method, URL, and other data from the failed test case, which is useful for
  attempting to reproduce the failure manually with `curl`.
- The specific `Errors` encountered when processing the API response that caused the failure. **This is the first place to look when debugging Tavern test failures.**

The following is an example `Source test stage`:

```text
Source test stage (line 179):
  - name: Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node
    request:
      url: "{base_url}/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?nid={nid}"
      method: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer {access_token}"
      verify: !bool "{verify}"
    response:
      status_code: 200
```

The following is an example `Formatted stage`:

```text
Formatted stage:
  name: Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node
  request:
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <REDACTED>
    method: GET
    url: 'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?nid=None'
    verify: !bool 'False'
  response:
    status_code: 200
```

The following is an example `Errors` section:

```text
Errors:
E   tavern.util.exceptions.TestFailError: Test 'Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node' failed:
    - Status code was 400, expected 200:
        {"type": "about:blank", "title": "Bad Request", "detail": "Need a mac=, name=, or nid= parameter", "status": 400}
```

## Additional troubleshooting

This section provides guidance for handling specific HMS health check failures that may occur.

### `run_hms_ct_tests.sh`

This script runs the suite of HMS CT tests.

#### `cray-hms-smd-test-functional`

This job executes the tests for Hardware State Manager (HSM).

##### `test_components.tavern.yaml` and `test_hardware.tavern.yaml`

These tests require compute nodes to be discovered in HSM.

The following is an example of a failed test execution due to no discovered compute nodes in HSM:

If these failures occur, see the [Test Failures Due To No Discovered Compute Nodes In HSM](./known_issues/test_failures_no_discovered_computes_in_hsm.md) documentation for further troubleshooting.

##### `test_components.tavern.yaml`

These tests include checks for healthy BMC states in HSM.

The following is an example of a failed test execution due to an unexpected BMC state in HSM:

Test failures due to unexpected BMC states in HSM can be safely ignored if there are BMCs in the system that are intentionally powered off, such as during system shutdown and power off testing.

#### `cray-hms-firmware-action-test-functional`

This job executes the tests for the Firmware Action Service (FAS).

##### `test_actions.tavern.yaml`

These tests require at least one healthy BMC (State=Ready, Flag=OK) in HSM.

The following is an example of a failed test execution due to no healthy BMCs in HSM:

```

These failures occur because PCS has not populated its ETCD cluster with data yet.

`(ncn-mw#)` Restarting the PCS pods will resolve this issue.

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n services deployment cray-power-control
```

`(ncn-mw#)` Monitor the restart.

```bash
kubectl rollout status -n services deployment cray-power-control
```

After PCS has been restarted successfully, the test can be executed again.

### `hsm_discovery_status_test.sh`

This test verifies that the system hardware has been discovered successfully.

The following is an example of a failed test execution:

```text

FAIL: hsm_discovery_status_test found 4 endpoints that failed discovery, maximum allowable is 1
'/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/hsm_discovery_status_test.sh' exited with status code: 1
```

The expected state of `LastDiscoveryStatus` is `DiscoverOK` for all endpoints with the exception of the BMC for `ncn-m001`, which is not normally connected to the site
network and therefore is expected to be `HTTPsGetFailed`. If the test fails due to two or more endpoints having failed discovery, then perform the following additional steps in order to
determine the cause of the failure:

#### `HTTPsGetFailed`

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) resolves using the `nslookup` command.

    If not, then the problem may be a DNS issue.

    ```bash
    nslookup <xname>
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) responds to the `ping` command.

    If not, then the problem may be a network or hardware issue.

    ```bash
    ping -c 1 <xname>
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) responds to a Redfish query.

    If not, then the problem may be a credentials issue. Use the password set in the HMS Discovery (REDS) sealed secret.

    ```bash
    curl -s -k -u root:<password> https://<xname>/redfish/v1/Managers | jq
    ```

If discovery failures for Gigabyte CMCs with component names (xnames) of the form `xXc0sSb999` occur, then verify that the `root` service account is configured for
the CMC and add it if needed. See
[Add Root Service Account for Gigabyte Controllers](../operations/security_and_authentication/Add_Root_Service_Account_for_Gigabyte_Controllers.md).

If discovery failures for HPE PDUs with component names (xnames) of the form `xXmM` occur, this may indicate that configuration steps have not yet been executed which
are required for the PDUs to be discovered. Refer to [HPE PDU Administrative Procedures](../operations/hpe_pdu/hpe_pdu_admin_procedures.md) for additional
configuration for this type of PDU. The steps to run will depend on if the PDU has been set up yet, and whether or not an upgrade or fresh install of CSM is being performed.

#### `ChildVerificationFailed`

Check the SMD logs to determine the cause of the bad Redfish path encountered during discovery.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Get the SMD pod names.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-smd
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-9b2lj   2/2     Running   0          24d
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-bnztf   2/2     Running   0          24d
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-hhc5p   2/2     Running   0          24d
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Get the logs from each of the SMD pods.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod1> cray-smd > smd_pod1_logs
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod2> cray-smd > smd_pod2_logs
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod3> cray-smd > smd_pod3_logs
    ```

#### `DiscoveryStarted`

The endpoint is in the process of being inventoried by Hardware State Manager (HSM). Wait for the current discovery operation to finish which should result in a new
`LastDiscoveryStatus` state being set for the endpoint.

(`ncn-mw#`) Use the following command to check the current discovery status of the endpoint:

```bash
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints describe <xname>
```

## Install blocking vs. Non-blocking failures

The HMS health checks include tests for multiple types of system components, some of which are critical for the installation of the system, while others are not.

The following types of HMS test failures should be considered blocking for system installations:

- HMS service pods not running
- HMS service APIs unreachable through the API Gateway or Cray CLI
- Failures related to HMS discovery (for example: unreachable BMCs, unresponsive controller hardware, or no Redfish connectivity)

The following types of HMS test failures should **not** be considered blocking for system installations:

- Failures because of hardware issues on individual nodes (alerts or warning flags set in HSM)

It is typically safe to postpone the investigation and resolution of non-blocking failures until after the CSM installation or upgrade has completed.
