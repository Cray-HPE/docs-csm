## Introduction

This document describes how to interpret the results of the HMS Health Check scripts and techniques for troubleshooting when failures occur.

## Overview

The HMS CT tests are API tests intended to verify that HMS services are installed, operational, and behave as expected. There are two types of CT tests for HMS
services: smoke and functional. Both are executed via Helm test jobs that are defined in the Helm chart for the service that they test. The CT smoke and functional
tests are invoked using the `helm test` command on worker or master NCNs (if applicable). Administrators execute the HMS CT tests using a script called
`run_hms_ct_tests.sh` as part of the CSM health validation procedures.

The CT smoke tests are basic API tests that make calls to HMS service APIs and verify that the expected status codes are returned. They run first for each service
and are useful for verifying that HMS services are installed and responsive. These tests will fail if the service being tested is not installed, unhealthy,
or unresponsive.

The CT functional tests are more rigorous API tests that inspect the response bodies and verify that the fields, values, and form of the data returned are as expected.
They run after the smoke tests and verify that HMS service APIs behave correctly and in accordance with their API specification. They also detect issues that prevent
the proper management or expected use of hardware in the system.

## Execution

The `run_hms_ct_tests.sh` script executes the HMS CT tests in parallel. It waits for each Helm test job to complete, logs the results in a file for the test run, and
prints a summary of the results. The script returns a status code of zero if all tests pass and non-zero if there are one or more failures.

Example output:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
SUCCESS: All 9 service tests passed: bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, hsm, reds, scsd, sls
```

The following is example output reporting a single service failure:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
FAILURE: 1 service test FAILED (hsm), 8 passed (bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, reds, scsd, sls)
For troubleshooting and manual steps, see: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/troubleshooting/hms_ct_manual_run.md
```

The following is an example output reporting multiple service failures:

```text
Log file for run is: /opt/cray/tests/hms_ct_test-<datetime>.log
Running all tests...
DONE.
FAILURE: All 9 service tests FAILED: bss, capmc, fas, hbtd, hmnfd, hsm, reds, scsd, sls
For troubleshooting and manual steps, see: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/blob/main/troubleshooting/hms_ct_manual_run.md
```

## Failure analysis

If one or more service tests fail, the log file for the run should be inspected to determine which test job(s) failed.

### Smoke test failure

The following is an example section of a log file reporting a smoke test failure:

```text
NAME: cray-hms-smd
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jun 16 15:46:10 2022
NAMESPACE: services
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 9
TEST SUITE:     cray-hms-smd-test-smoke
Last Started:   Fri Jul  1 21:12:58 2022
Last Completed: Fri Jul  1 21:14:25 2022
Phase:          Failed
```

In this case, the HSM smoke test job failed. Find the name of the pod and inspect its logs to determine the cause of the failure.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Find the name of the pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods | grep -E "smd|NAME"
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME                                                              READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE

    cray-smd-747b59d979-c5rhl                                         2/2     Running            0          4d5h
    cray-smd-747b59d979-vcv6c                                         2/2     Running            0          4d6h
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Show its logs.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs cray-hms-smd-test-smoke-2npqz smoke
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

    2022-07-01 21:13:09,282 FAIL: hsm-smoke-tests ran with failures
    ```

### Functional test failure

The following is an example section of a log file reporting a functional test failure:

```text
NAME: cray-hms-smd
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jun 16 15:46:10 2022
NAMESPACE: services

Last Completed: Fri Jul  1 21:14:25 2022
Phase:          Failed
```

In this case, the HSM functional test job failed. Find the name of the pod and inspect its logs to determine the cause of the failure.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Find the name of the pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods | grep -E "smd|NAME"
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Show its logs.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs cray-hms-smd-test-functional-fs8b4 functional
    ```

    Example output:

## Tavern output

Tavern is a `pytest`-based API testing framework. The CT functional tests consist of Tavern tests for HMS services that are written in YAML and are executed via Helm test
jobs. This section describes the output format of Tavern and where to look when investigating functional test failures.

First, a summary of the test suites executed and their results is printed:

```text

```

When test failures occur, additional output is printed below the summary table that includes the following:

- The `Source test stage` that was executing when the failure occurred. This is a portion of the source code for the failed test case.
- The `Formatted stage` that was executing when the failure occurred. This is a portion of the source code for the failed test case with its variables filled in with
  the values that were set at the time of the failure. This includes the request header, method, URL, and other data from the failed test case, which is useful for
  attempting to reproduce the failure manually with `curl`.
- The specific `Errors` encountered when processing the API response that caused the failure. **This is the first place to look when debugging Tavern test failures.**

The following is an example `Source test stage`:

```text
Source test stage (line 179):
  - name: Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node
    request:
      url: "{base_url}/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?nid={nid}"
      method: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer {access_token}"
      verify: !bool "{verify}"
    response:
      status_code: 200
```

The following is an example `Formatted stage`:

```text
Formatted stage:
  name: Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node
  request:
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <REDACTED>
    method: GET
    url: 'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?nid=None'
    verify: !bool 'False'
  response:
    status_code: 200
```

The following is an example `Errors` section:

```text
Errors:
E   tavern.util.exceptions.TestFailError: Test 'Ensure the boot script service can provide the bootscript for a given node' failed:
    - Status code was 400, expected 200:
        {"type": "about:blank", "title": "Bad Request", "detail": "Need a mac=, name=, or nid= parameter", "status": 400}
```

## Additional troubleshooting

This section provides guidance for handling specific HMS health check failures that may occur.

### `run_hms_ct_tests.sh`

This script runs the suite of HMS CT tests.

#### `cray-hms-smd-test-functional`

This job executes the tests for Hardware State Manager (HSM).

##### `test_components.tavern.yaml and test_hardware.tavern.yaml`

These tests require compute nodes to be discovered in HSM.

The following is an example of a failed test execution due to no discovered compute nodes in HSM:

```

(`ncn-mw#`) If these failures occur, confirm that there are no discovered compute nodes in HSM.

```bash
cray hsm state components list --type=Node --role=compute --format=json
```

Example output:

```text
{
  "Components": []
}
```

There are several reasons why there may be no discovered compute nodes in HSM.

The following situations do not warrant additional troubleshooting and the test failures can be safely ignored if:

- There is no compute hardware physically connected to the system
- All compute hardware in the system is powered off

If none of the above cases are applicable, then the failures warrant additional troubleshooting:

(`ncn-mw#`) Run the `hsm_discovery_status_test.sh` script.

```bash
/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/hsm_discovery_status_test.sh
```

If the script fails, this indicates a discovery issue and further troubleshooting steps to take are printed.

Otherwise, missing compute nodes in HSM with no discovery failures may indicate a problem with a `leaf-bmc` switch.

(`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the `leaf-bmc` switch resolves using the `nslookup` command.

```bash
nslookup <leaf-bmc-switch>
```

Example output:

```text
Server:     10.92.100.225
Address:    10.92.100.225#53

Name:   sw-leaf-bmc-001.nmn
Address: 10.252.0.4
```

(`ncn-mw#`) Verify connectivity to the `leaf-bmc` switch.

```bash
ssh admin@<leaf-bmc-switch>
```

Example output:

```text
ssh: connect to host sw-leaf-bmc-001 port 22: Connection timed out
```

Restoring connectivity, resolving configuration issues, or restarting the relevant ports on the `leaf-bmc` switch should allow the compute hardware to issue DHCP requests again and be discovered successfully.

### `hsm_discovery_status_test.sh`

This test verifies that the system hardware has been discovered successfully.

The following is an example of a failed test execution:

```text
Running hsm_discovery_status_test...
(22:19:34) Getting client secret...
(22:19:34) Retrieving authentication token...

(22:19:35) Processing response with: 'jq '.RedfishEndpoints[] | { ID: .ID, LastDiscoveryStatus: .DiscoveryInfo.LastDiscoveryStatus}' -c | sort -V | jq -c'...

{"ID":"x3000c0s27b0","LastDiscoveryStatus":"ChildVerificationFailed"}
FAIL: hsm_discovery_status_test found 4 endpoints that failed discovery, maximum allowable is 1
'/opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/hsm_discovery_status_test.sh' exited with status code: 1
```

The expected state of `LastDiscoveryStatus` is `DiscoverOK` for all endpoints with the exception of the BMC for `ncn-m001`, which is not normally connected to the site
network and therefore is expected to be `HTTPsGetFailed`. If the test fails due to two or more endpoints having failed discovery, then perform the following additional steps in order to
determine the cause of the failure:

#### `HTTPsGetFailed`

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) resolves using the `nslookup` command.

    If not, then the problem may be a DNS issue.

    ```bash
    nslookup <xname>
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) responds to the `ping` command.

    If not, then the problem may be a network or hardware issue.

    ```bash
    ping -c 1 <xname>
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check to see if the failed component name (xname) responds to a Redfish query.

    If not, then the problem may be a credentials issue. Use the password set in the REDS sealed secret.

    ```bash
    curl -s -k -u root:<password> https://<xname>/redfish/v1/Managers | jq
    ```

If discovery failures for Gigabyte CMCs with component names (xnames) of the form `xXc0sSb999` occur, then verify that the `root` service account is configured for
the CMC and add it if needed. See
[Add Root Service Account for Gigabyte Controllers](../operations/security_and_authentication/Add_Root_Service_Account_for_Gigabyte_Controllers.md).

If discovery failures for HPE PDUs with component names (xnames) of the form `xXmM` occur, this may indicate that configuration steps have not yet been executed which
are required for the PDUs to be discovered. Refer to [HPE PDU Administrative Procedures](../operations/hpe_pdu/hpe_pdu_admin_procedures.md) for additional
configuration for this type of PDU. The steps to run will depend on if the PDU has been set up yet, and whether or not an upgrade or fresh install of CSM is being performed.

#### `ChildVerificationFailed`

Check the SMD logs to determine the cause of the bad Redfish path encountered during discovery.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Get the SMD pod names.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-smd
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-9b2lj   2/2     Running   0          24d
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-bnztf   2/2     Running   0          24d
    cray-smd-5b9d574756-hhc5p   2/2     Running   0          24d
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Get the logs from each of the SMD pods.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod1> cray-smd > smd_pod1_logs
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod2> cray-smd > smd_pod2_logs
    kubectl -n services logs <cray-smd-pod3> cray-smd > smd_pod3_logs
    ```

#### `DiscoveryStarted`

The endpoint is in the process of being inventoried by Hardware State Manager (HSM). Wait for the current discovery operation to finish which should result in a new
`LastDiscoveryStatus` state being set for the endpoint.

(`ncn-mw#`) Use the following command to check the current discovery status of the endpoint:

```bash
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints describe <xname>
```

## Install blocking vs. Non-blocking failures

The HMS health checks include tests for multiple types of system components, some of which are critical for the installation of the system, while others are not.

The following types of HMS test failures should be considered blocking for system installations:

- HMS service pods not running
- HMS service APIs unreachable through the API Gateway or Cray CLI
- Failures related to HMS discovery (for example: unreachable BMCs, unresponsive controller hardware, or no Redfish connectivity)

The following types of HMS test failures should **not** be considered blocking for system installations:

- Failures because of hardware issues on individual nodes (alerts or warning flags set in HSM)

It is typically safe to postpone the investigation and resolution of non-blocking failures until after the CSM installation or upgrade has completed.
