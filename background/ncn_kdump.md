## What is `kdump`?

At a high-level, `kdump` is a Linux tool that takes a dump of the system memory at the time of a crash for analysis.
This dump is taken on a local disk, or it can be taken on a network drive.

The dump can provide insight into the origin of the crash, such as which kernel modules were running and which may have contributed to the crash.

Taking a dump is only possible when a portion of memory is reserved for `kdump`, because when a system goes down, there is no way to
map which memory is free or in use. In the event of a crash, the Linux OS invokes `kexec` to load the `kdump` `initrd` into
the reserved memory space. This enables the system to continue running after a crash. During this time, `kdump` provides tools
that enable taking a dump of everything loaded in memory.

The dumps are conventionally written to `/var/crash` for analysis on the same machine following a reboot (assuming it
does not crash again), or the disk can be relocated to a stable machine. If the dump is taken over the network, then analysis
can be done using that network drive.

For information on analyzing a dump, see [Analyzing a dump](#analyzing-a-dump).

## Usage

This usage sections denotes how the non-compute nodes configure and configure `kdump`.

### Configuration

`kdump` is configured by the `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` file, this file controls various aspects of `kdump`
such as:

* The crash directory.
* The kernel parameters used in the `kdump` `initrd`.

### Dracut

For SquashFS booted non-compute nodes, the `dracut-metal-mdsquash` module does some preparation for `kdump` by creating two symbolic links
in the [root overlay](./ncn_mounts_and_filesystems.md#overlayfs-and-persistence).

* `ls $(lsblk -o MOUNTPOINT -nr /dev/disk/by-label/ROOTRAID)/boot` points to the actual `/boot` directory.
* `ls $(lsblk -o MOUNTPOINT -nr /dev/disk/by-label/ROOTRAID)/crash` points to the actual `/var/crash` directory.

These symbolic links are important for `kdump` to work. `kdump` will mount the `ROOTRAID` as the root filesystem, and then look for:

* `/boot` to find the kernel image and `System.map` symbols file.
* The crash directory specified in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` (e.g. `/crash`)

> ***Q/A*** *Why does `kdump` look for the `ROOTRAID`?
>
> `kdump` looks for the `ROOTRAID` because the `/etc/fstab` file denotes that `/` is on `LABEL=ROOTRAID`. `kdump` can look at either `/etc/fstab` or
> `/proc/mounts` to resolve the root. `/proc/mounts` is not used because `kdump` will resolve the OverlayFS as the root filesystem, which is very
> complicated to setup within the `kdump` `initrd`. Instead, `kdump` reads `/etc/fstab` and then provide a mountable filesystem that is not
> an OverlayFS. The `ROOTRAID` is the upper-directory of the OverlayFS for the root filesystem; anything written here will appear as if it was written
> to a filesystem mounted at `/`.

### Enabling / disabling

`kdump` is enabled when both the `kdump` package is installed *and* when the `crashkernel` parameter is present on the kernel command line.

## Analyzing a dump

A dump can be inspected using the `crash` command. The analysis requires `kernel-default-debuginfo`
to be installed; the `crash` command can not thoroughly analyze a dump without that package.

1. SSH to the node that has the dump.

1. (`ncn#`) Install `kernel-default-debug` on the node with the dump.

   > ***NOTE*** The `kernel-default-debug` package for the current kernel (the kernel associated with the dump) must be installed.
   > The steps below load the `dracut-lib.sh` library which sets the `KVER` variable; this variable contains that value.

    * Install from the embedded repository.

        ```bash
        zypper ar https://packages.local/repository/csm-${CSM_RELEASE}-embedded csm-embedded
        KVER=$(rpm -q --queryformat='%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}' kernel-default)
        zypper --plus-content debug in -y kernel-default-debuginfo=${KVER%-default}
        ```

    * Install from Artifactory if credentials are available.

        1. Set Artifactory user credential.

            ```bash
            read -s ARTIFACTORY_USER
            ````

        1. Set Artifactory token credential.

            ```bash
            read -s ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN
            ```

        1. Install from Artifactory.

            > ***NOTE*** CSM does NOT support the use of proxy servers for anything other than downloading artifacts from external endpoints.
            Using `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` in any way other than the following examples will cause many failures in subsequent steps.

            * Without proxy:

              ```bash
              DISTRO="$(grep VERSION= /etc/os-release | awk -F= '{print $NF}' | tr -d \")"
              zypper ar https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/sles-mirror/Updates/SLE-Module-Basesystem/${DISTRO}/$(uname -i)/update_debug/ temp-debug
              KVER=$(rpm -q --queryformat='%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}' kernel-default)
              zypper --plus-content debug in -y kernel-default-debuginfo=${KVER%-default}
              ```

            * With https proxy:

              ```bash
              DISTRO="$(grep VERSION= /etc/os-release | awk -F= '{print $NF}' | tr -d \")"
              https_proxy=https://example.proxy.net:443 zypper ar https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/sles-mirror/Updates/SLE-Module-Basesystem/${DISTRO}/$(uname -i)/update_debug/ temp-debug
              KVER=$(rpm -q --queryformat='%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}' kernel-default)
              zypper --plus-content debug in -y kernel-default-debuginfo=${KVER%-default}
              ```

1. (`ncn#`) On the node with the dump, select a crash dump and navigate to its directory.

    1. List all available crash dumps.

        ```bash
        cd /var/crash
        ls -l
        ```

    1. Change to the desired crash dump directory.

        For example, if `2022-09-07-14:31` was the crash to be examined:

        ```bash
        cd /var/crash/2022-09-07-14\:31
        ```

1. (`ncn#`) Run `crash` from within the crash directory.

    This will open a crash console.

    > ***NOTE*** This assumes that the crash's kernel and the running kernel are the same.
    > The loaded `dracut-lib.sh` provides the `KVER` variable which has a value equal to
    > that of the currently running kernel.

    ```bash
    . /srv/cray/scripts/common/dracut-lib.sh
    crash ./vmlinux-${KVER}.gz ./vmcore
    ```

1. Use the open crash console to inspect the dump.

    Type `?` for help.

## Troubleshooting

This section will assist an administrator or tester in handling broken dumps.

### `kdump` has hung

During the crash, if `kdump` hangs and never creates a dump after 5 minutes, then the node should be reset.

An example of a frozen crash might look like this:

```

1. (`ncn#`) Reset the targetted node.

    1. Set the IPMI username.

        ```bash
        read -s USERNAME
        ```

    1. Set the IPMI password.

        ```bash
        read -s IPMI_PASSWORD
        ```

    1. Export the IPMI password.

        ```bash
        export IPMI_PASSWORD
        ```

    1. Set the node to target.

        ```bash
        NODE=ncn-w001
        ```

    1. Reset the node.

        ```bash
        ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H ${NODE}-mgmt power reset 
        ```

### Resetting `kdump`

If `kdump` fails any of the validation tests, then it can be easily remedied by purging the bad `initrd` and
restarting the `kdump.service` daemon.

1. (`ncn#`) Purge all old `kdump` images.

    ```bash
    rm -f /boot/initrd-*-kdump
    ```

1. (`ncn#`) Restart the `kdump.service` daemon.

    This will take 10-30 seconds.

    ```bash
    systemctl restart kdump.service
    ```

1. (`ncn#`) Verify that a new `kdump` image exists for the current kernel.

    ```bash
    . /srv/cray/scripts/common/dracut-lib.sh
    ls -l /boot/initrd-${KVER}-kdump
    ```
