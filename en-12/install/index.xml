      <description>Clear Gigabyte CMOS Because of a bug in the Gigabyte firmware, the Shasta 1.5 install may negatively impact Gigabyte motherboards when attempting to boot using bonded Mellanox network cards. The result is a board that is unusable until a CMOS clear is physically done via a jumper on the board itself.&#xA;A patched firmware release (newer than C20 BIOS) is expected to be available for a future release of Shasta. It is recommended that Gigabyte users wait for this new firmware before attempting an installation of Shasta 1.</description>

      <description>Configure Administrative Access There are several operations which configure administrative access to different parts of the system. Ensuring that the cray CLI can be used with administrative credentials enables use of many management services via commands. The management nodes can be locked from accidental manipulation by the cray capmc and cray fas commands when the intent is to work on the entire system except the management nodes. The cray scsd command can change the SSH keys, NTP server, syslog server, and BMC/controller passwords.</description>

      <description>Reset root Password on LiveCD It may become desirable to clear the password on the LiveCD.&#xA;The root password is preserved within the COW partition at cow:rw/etc/shadow. This is the modified copy of the /etc/shadow file used by the operating system.&#xA;If a site/user needs to reset/clear the password for root, they can mount their USB on another machine and remove this file from the COW partition. When next booting from the USB it will reinitialize to an empty password for root, and again at next login it will require the password to be changed.</description>

      <description>Restart Network Services and Interfaces on NCNs Interfaces within the network stack can be reloaded or reset to fix wedged interfaces. The NCNs have network device names set during first boot. The names vary based on the available hardware. For more information, see NCN Networking. Any process covered on this page will be covered by the installer.&#xA;The use cases for resetting services:&#xA;Interfaces not showing up IP Addresses not applying Member/children interfaces not being included Topics Restart Network Services and Interfaces))) Command Reference Check interface status (up/down/broken) Show routing and status for all devices Print real devices ( ignore no-device ) Show the currently enabled network service (Wicked or Network Manager) Restart Network Services There are a few daemons that make up the SUSE network stack.</description>
