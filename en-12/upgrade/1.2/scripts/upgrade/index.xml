      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how we automate upgrade process. In a nutshell, an upgrade is:&#xA;Upload new artifacts into a running system Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded. Prerequisites Everything we need before upgrading an NCN.&#xA;NOTE:&#xA;The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002. If an action is only needed to run once, developers must add logic to avoid running this action both times the script is executed.</description>
