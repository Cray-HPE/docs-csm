## Application Node (AN)

An application node (AN) is an NCN which is not providing management functions for the HPE Cray EX system.
The AN is not part of the Kubernetes cluster to which management nodes belong. One special type of AN
is the UAN (User Access Node), but different systems may have need for other types of ANs, such as:

* nodes which provide a Lustre routing function (LNet router)
* gateways between HSN and InfiniBand
* data movers between two different network file systems
* visualization servers
* other special-purpose nodes

## Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)

Air-Cooled cabinet COTS servers that include a Redfish-enabled baseboard management
controller (BMC) and REST endpoint for API control and management. Either IPMI
commands or REST API calls can be used to manage a BMC.

## Blade Switch Controller (sC)

The Slingshot blade switch embedded controller (sC) provides a hardware management
REST endpoint to monitor environmental conditions and manage the blade power, switch
ASIC, FPGA buffer/interfaces, and firmware.

## Boot Script Service (BSS)

The Boot Script Service stores the configuration information that is used to boot each hardware
component. Nodes consult BSS for their boot artifacts and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot.

## Boot Orchestration Service (BOS)

The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down
collections of nodes. This is accomplished using BOS components, such as boot orchestration session
templates and sessions. BOS uses other services which provide boot artifact configuration (BSS),
power control (CAPMC), node status (HSM), and configuration (CFS).

## Cabinet Cooling Group

A cabinet cooling group is a group of Olympus cabinets that are connected to a floor-standing coolant
distribution unit (CDU). Management network CDU switches in the CDU aggregate all the
node management network (NMN) and hardware management network (HMN) connections
for the cabinet group.

## Cabinet Environmental Controller (CEC)

The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet environmental controller (CEC) sets the cabinet's geolocation,
monitors environmental sensors, and communicates status to the cooling distribution unit
(CDU). The CEC microcontroller (eC) signals the cooling distribution unit (CDU) to start
liquid cooling and then enables the DC rectifiers so that a chassis can be powered on. The
CEC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet, it simply provides the cabinet
environmental and CDU status to the CMM for evaluation or action; the CEC takes no
action. The CEC firmware is flashed automatically when the CMM firmware is flashed. If
there are momentary erroneous signals because of a CEC reset or cable disconnection, the
system can ride through these events without issuing an EPO.

## CEC microcontroller (eC)

The CEC microcontroller (eC) sets the cabinet's geolocation, monitors the cabinet
environmental sensors, and communicates cabinet status to the cooling distribution unit
(CDU). The eC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet as do other embedded
controllers, but simply monitors the cabinet sensors and provides the cabinet environmental
and CDU status to the CMMs for evaluation and/or action.

## Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS)

The Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) upgrades sets of compute nodes without requiring an entire set of nodes to be out of service at once. CRUS manages the workload
management status of nodes, handling each of the steps required to upgrade compute nodes.

See [Compute Rolling Upgrades](operations/index.md#compute-rolling-upgrades).

> **`NOTE`** CRUS was deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and it will be removed in CSM 1.6.0.
> See the following links for more information:
>
> * [Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2](operations/boot_orchestration/Rolling_Upgrades.md)
> * [Deprecated features](introduction/differences.md#deprecated-features)

## Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC)

The Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service enables direct hardware control of
power on/off, power monitoring, or system-wide power telemetry and configuration parameters from Redfish.
CAPMC implements a simple interface for powering on/off compute nodes and application nodes, querying
node state information, and querying site-specific service usage rules. These controls enable external
software to more intelligently manage system-wide power consumption or configuration parameters.

## Cray CLI (`cray`)

The `cray` command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management
REST APIs into easily usable commands.

## Customer Access Network

The Customer Access Network (CAN) provides access from outside the customer network to services, noncompute
nodes (NCNs), and User Access Nodes (UANs) in the system. This allows for the following:

* Clients outside of the system:
  * Log in to each of the NCNs and UANs.
  * Access web UIs within the system (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, and more).
  * Access the Rest APIs within the system.
  * Access a DNS server within the system for resolution of names for the webUI and REST API services.
  * Run Cray CLI commands from outside the system.
  * Access the User Access Instances (UAI).
* NCNs and UANs to access systems outside the cluster (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more).
* Services within the cluster to access systems outside the cluster.

These nodes and services need an IP address that routes to the customer's network in order to be accessed from
outside the network.

## Chassis Management Module (CMM)

The cabinet chassis management module (CMM) provides a REST endpoint via its chassis
controller (cC). The CMM is an embedded controller that monitors and controls all the
blades in a chassis. Each chassis supports 8 compute blades and 8 switches and
associated rectifiers/PSUs in the rectifier shelf.
Power Considerations - Two CMMs in adjacent chassis share power from the rectifier
shelf (a shelf connects two adjacent chassis - 0 and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7). If
both CMMs sharing shelf power are both enabling the rectifiers, one of the CMMs can be
removed (but only one at a time) without the rectifier shelf powering off. Removing a
CMM will shutdown all compute blades and switches in the chassis.
Cooling Considerations - Any single CMM in any cabinet can enable CDU cooling. Note
that the CDU "enable path" has vertical control which means CMMs 0, 2, 4, and 6 and CEC0 are
in a path (half of the cabinet), and CMMs 1, 3, 5, and 7 and CEC1 are in another path. Any CMM
or CEC in the same half-cabinet path can be removed and CDU cooling will stay enabled as
long as the other CMMs/CEC enables CDU cooling.

## Compute Node (CN)

The compute node (CN) is where high performance computing application are run. These have
hostnames that are of the form `nidXXXXXX`, that is, `nid` followed by six digits.
where the `XXXXXX` is a six digit number starting with zero padding.

## Configuration Framework Service (CFS)

The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is available on systems for remote execution and
configuration management of nodes and boot images. This includes nodes available in the
Hardware State Manager (HSM) service inventory (compute, management, and application nodes),
and boot images hosted by the Image Management Service (IMS).

CFS configures nodes and images via a GitOps methodology. All configuration content is stored in a
version control service \(VCS\), and is managed by authorized system administrators. CFS provides a
scalable Ansible Execution Environment \(AEE\) for the configuration to be applied with flexible
inventory and node targeting options.

## Content Projection Service (CPS)

The Content Projection Service (CPS) provides the root filesystem for compute nodes and application
nodes in conjunction with the Data Virtualization Service (DVS). Using CPS and DVS, the HPE Cray
Programming Environment (CPE) and Analytics products are provided as separately mounted filesystems
to compute nodes, application nodes (such as UANs), and worker nodes hosting UAI pods.

## Cray Site Init (CSI)

The Cray Site Init (CSI) program creates, validates, installs, and upgrades an HPE Cray EX system.
CSI can prepare the LiveCD for booting the PIT node and then is used from a booted PIT node
to do its other functions during an installation. During an upgrade, CSI is installed on
one of the nodes to facilitate the CSM software upgrade.

## Cray System Management (CSM)

Cray System Management (CSM) refers to the product stream which provides the infrastructure to
manage an HPE Cray EX system using Kubernetes to manage the containerized workload of layered
micro-services with well-defined REST APIs which provide the ability to discover and control the
hardware platform, manage configuration of the system, configure the network, boot nodes, gather
log and telemetry data, connect API access and user level access to Identity Providers (IdPs),
and provide a method for system administrators and end-users to access the HPE Cray EX system.

## Data Virtualization Service (DVS)

The Data Virtualization Service (DVS) is a distributed network service that projects file systems
mounted on non-compute nodes (NCN) to other nodes within the HPE Cray EX system. Projecting is
the process of making a file system available on nodes where it does not physically reside.
DVS-specific configuration settings enable clients to access a file system projected by DVS
servers. These clients include compute nodes, User Access Nodes (UANs), and other management
nodes running User Access Instances (UAIs). Thus DVS, while not a file system, represents a
software layer that provides scalable transport for file system services. DVS is integrated
with the Content Projection Service (CPS).

## EX Compute Cabinet

A Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute blades and 64
high-speed network (HSN) switches.

## Image Management Service (IMS)

The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from
recipes. IMS also uses CFS to apply image customization for pre-boot configuration of the image root.
These images are bootable on compute nodes and application nodes.

## EX TDS Cabinet

A Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 2-chassis, 16
compute blades and 16 high-speed network (HSN) switches, and includes a rack-mounted

configuration settings for the Slingshot high-speed network.

## Floor Standing CDU

A floor-standing coolant distribution unit (CDU) pumps liquid coolant through a cabinet
group or cabinet chilled doors.

## Hardware Management Network (HMN)

The hardware management network (HMN) includes HMS embedded controllers. This
includes chassis controllers (cC), node controllers (nC) and switch controllers (sC), for
Liquid-Cooled TDS and Liquid-Cooled Olympus systems. For standard rack systems, this includes
iPDUs, COTS server BMCs, or any other equipment that requires hardware-management
with Redfish. The hardware management network is isolated from all other node
management networks. An out-of-band Ethernet management switch and hardware
management VLAN is used for customer access and administration of hardware.

## Hardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD)

The Hardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) service receives component state change
notifications from the HSM. It fans notifications out to subscribers (typically compute nodes).

## Hardware State Manager (HSM)

Hardware State Manager (HSM) service monitors and interrogates hardware components in an HPE Cray EX system,
tracking hardware state and inventory information, and making it available via REST queries and message bus
events when changes occur.

## Heartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD)

The Heartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD) service listens for heartbeats from components (mainly compute nodes).
It tracks changes in heartbeats and conveys changes to HSM.

## High Speed Network (HSN)

The High Speed Network (HSN) in an HPE Cray EX system is based on the Slingshot switches.

## Management Nodes

The management nodes refer to [non-compute nodes (NCNs)](#non-compute-node-ncn). Management nodes
provide containerization services as well as storage classes.

The management nodes have various roles:

* Masters nodes are Kubernetes masters.
* Worker nodes are Kubernetes workers and have physical connections to the [High Speed Network](#high-speed-network-hsn).
* Storage nodes physically have more local storage for providing storage classes to Kubernetes.

## Mountain Cabinet

See Olympus cabinet. Some software and documentation refers to the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.

## Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS)

The Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation
of Redfish-enabled BMCs in liquid-cooled Olympus cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to
determine if hardware is present or missing.

## NIC Mezzanine Card (NMC)

The NIC mezzanine card (NMC) attaches to two host port connections on a liquid-cooled
compute blade node card and provides the high-speed network (HSN) controllers (NICs).
There are typically two or four NICs on each node card. NMCs connect to the rear panel
EXAMAX connectors on the compute blade through an internal L0 cable assembly in a
single-, dual-, or quad-injection bandwidth configuration depending on the design of the
node card.

## Node Controller (nC)

Each compute blade node card includes an embedded node controller (nC) and REST
endpoint to manage the node environmental conditions, power, HMS nFPGA interface, and
firmware.

## Node Management Network

The node management network (NMN) communicates with motherboard PCH-style hosts,
typically 10GbE Ethernet LAN-on-motherboard (LOM) interfaces. This network supports
node boot protocols (DHCP/TFTP/HTTP), in-band telemetry and event exchange, and
general access to management REST APIs.

## Non-Compute Node (NCN)

The non-compute nodes are in the management-plane, these nodes serve infrastructure for microservices
(e.g. Kubernetes and storage classes).

## Olympus Cabinet

The Olympus cabinet is a liquid-cooled dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute
blades and 64 high-speed network (HSN) switches. Every HPE Cray EX system with Olympus
cabinets will also have at least one River cabinet to house non-compute node components
such as management nodes, management network switches, storage nodes, application nodes,
and possibly other air-cooled compute nodes. Some software and documentation refers to
the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.

## Power Distribution Unit (PDU)

The cabinet PDU receives 480VAC 3-phase facility power and
provides circuit breaker, fuse protection, and EMI filtered power to the rectifier/power
supplies that distribute ±190VDC (HVDC) to a chassis. PDUs are passive devices that do
not connect to the SMNet.

## Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT)

The Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT), also known as the *Cray Pre-Install Toolkit"*, provides a framework installing [Cray Systems Management](#cray-system-management-csm).
The PIT can be used on any node in the system for recovery and bare-metal discovery, the PIT includes tooling
for recovering any [non-compute nodes](#non-compute-node-ncn), and can remotely recover other [NCNs](#non-compute-node-ncn).

Regarding [CSM](#cray-system-management-csm) installations, typically the first Kubernetes master (`ncn-m001`) is chosen for
running the PIT during a [CSM](#cray-system-management-csm) installation. After [CSM](#cray-system-management-csm) is installed,
the node running the PIT will be rebooted and deployed via [CSM](#cray-system-management-csm) services before finally joining
the running Kubernetes cluster.

The PIT is delivered as a [LiveCD](#livecd), a disk image that can be used to remotely boot a node (e.g. a [RemoteISO](#remoteiso)) or by a USB stick.

### LiveCD

The term *LiveCD* refers to the artifact, the literal image file that contains the pre-install toolkit.

### RemoteISO

The term *RemoteISO* refers to a [LiveCD](#livecd) that is remotely mounted on a server. A remotely mounted LiveCD has no persistence,
a reboot of a RemoteISO will lose all data/information from the running session.

## Rack-Mounted CDU

The rack-mounted coolant distribution unit (MCDU-4U) pumps liquid coolant through the
Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet coolant manifolds.

## Rack System Compute Cabinet

Air-Cooled compute cabinets house a cluster of compute nodes, Slingshot ToR switches,
and SMNet ToR switches.

## Redfish Translation Service (RTS)

The Redfish Translation Service (RTS) aids in management of any hardware components which are not managed by
Redfish, such as a ServerTech PDU in a River Cabinet.

## River Cabinet

At least one 19 inch IEA management cabinet is required for every HPE Cray EX system to
support the [management nodes](#management-nodes), system management network, utility
storage, and other support equipment. This cabinet serves as the primary customer access
point for managing the system.

## River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS)

The River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of
Redfish-enabled BMCs in air-cooled River cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if
hardware is present or missing.

## Rosetta ASIC

The Rosetta ASIC is a 64-port switch chip that forms the foundation for the Slingshot
network. Each port can operate at either 100G or 200G. Each network edge port supports
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, optimized-IP based protocols, and portals (an enhanced frame format
that supports higher rates of small messages).

## Service/IO Cabinet

An Air-Cooled service/IO cabinet houses a cluster of NCN servers, Slingshot ToR switches,
and management network ToR switches to support the managed ecosystem storage,
network, user access services (UAS), and other IO services such as LNet and gateways.

## Slingshot

Slingshot supports L1 and L2 network connectivity between 200 Gbs switch ports and L0
connectivity from a single 200 Gbs port to two 100 Gbs Mellanox ConnectX-5 NICs. Slingshot
also supports edge ports and link aggregation groups (LAG) to external storage systems or
networks.

## Slingshot Blade Switch

The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet blade switch supports one switch ASIC and 48 fabric ports. Eight
connectors on the rear panel connect orthogonally to each compute blade then to NIC
mezzanine cards (NMCs) inside the compute blade. Each rear panel EXAMAX connector
supports two switch ports (a total of 16 fabric ports per blade). Twelve QSFP-DD cages on
the front panel (4 fabric ports per QSFP-DD cage), fan out 48 external fabric ports to other
switches. The front-panel top ports support passive electrical cables (PEC) or active optical
cables (AOC). The front-panel bottom ports support only PECs for proper cooling in the
blade enclosure.

## Slingshot Top of Rack (ToR) Switch

A standard River cabinet can support one, two, or four, rack-mounted Slingshot ToR switches.
Each switch supports a total of 64 fabric ports. 32 QSFP-DD connectors on the front panel
connect 64 ports to the fabric. All front-panel connectors support either passive electrical
cables (PEC) or active optical cables (AOC).

## Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD)

The Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) is a multiple tab spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing
with information about the components in an HPE Cray EX system. This document has much information
about the system. Included in the SHCD are a configuration summary with revision history, floor layout
plan, type and location of components in the air-cooled cabinets, type and location of components in
the liquid-cooled cabinets, device diagrams for switches and nodes in the cabinets, list of source
and destination of every HSN cable, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the
spine switches, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the NMN, list of source
and destination of every cable connected to the HMN. list of cabling for the KVM, and routing of power to the PDUs.

## Supply/Return Cutoff Valves

Manual coolant supply and return shutoff valves at the top of each cabinet can be closed to
isolate a single cabinet from the other cabinets in the cooling group for maintenance. If the
valves are closed during operation, the action automatically causes the CMMs to remove
±190VDC from each chassis in the cabinet because of the loss of coolant pressure.

## System Admin Toolkit (SAT)

The System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product provides the `sat` command line interface which interacts with the REST APIs of many services to perform more complex system management tasks.

## System Layout Service (SLS)

The System Layout Service (SLS) serves as a "single source of truth" for the system design. It details
the physical locations of network hardware, management nodes, application nodes, compute nodes, and
cabinets. It also stores information about the network, such as which port on which switch should be connected to each node.

## System Management Network (SMNet)

The system management network (SMNet) is a dedicated out-of-band (OOB) spine-leaf
topology Ethernet network that interconnects all the nodes in the system to management
services.

## System Management Services (SMS)

System Management Services (SMS) leverages open REST APIs, Kubernetes container
orchestration, and a pool of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers to manage the system.
The management server pool, custom Redfish-enabled embedded controllers, iPDU
controllers, and server BMCs are unified under a common software platform that provides 3
levels of management: Level 1 HaaS, Level 2 IaaS, and Level 3 PaaS.

## System Management Services (SMS) nodes

System Management Services (SMS) nodes provide access to the entire management
cluster and Kubernetes container orchestration.

## Top of Rack Switch Controller (sC-ToR)

The Air-Cooled cabinet HSN ToR switch embedded controller (sC-ToR) provides a hardware
management REST endpoint to monitor the ToR switch environmental conditions and
manage the switch power, HSN ASIC, and FPGA interfaces.

## User Access Instance (UAI)

The User Access Instance (UAI) is a lightweight, disposable platform that runs under Kubernetes orchestration
on worker nodes. The UAI provides a single user containerized environment for users on a Cray Ex system to
develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAN for another
way for users to gain access.

## User Access Node (UAN)

The User Access Node (UAN) is an NCN, but is really one of the special types of application nodes.
The UAN provides a traditional multi-user Linux environment for users on a Cray Ex system to
develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAI for another
way for users to gain access. Some sites refer to their UANs as Login nodes.

## User Access Service (UAS)

The User Access Service (UAS) is a containerized service managed by Kubernetes that enables users to
create and run user applications inside a UAI. UAS runs on a management node that is acting as a
Kubernetes worker node. When a user requests a new UAI, the UAS service returns status and connection
information to the newly created UAI. External access to UAS is routed through a node that hosts
gateway services.

## Version Control Service (VCS)

The Version Control Service (VCS) provides configuration content to CFS via a GitOps methodology
based on a `git` server (`gitea`) that can be accessed by the `git` command but also includes a
web interface for repository management, pull requests, and a visual view of all repositories
and organizations.

## xname

Component names (xnames) identify the geolocation for hardware components in the HPE Cray EX system. Every
component is uniquely identified by these component names. Some, like the system cabinet number or the CDU
number, can be changed by site needs. There is no geolocation encoded within the cabinet number, such as an
X-Y coordinate system to relate to the floor layout of the cabinets. Other component names refer to the location
within a cabinet and go down to the port on a card or switch or the socket holding a processor or a memory DIMM
location. See [Component Names (xnames)](operations/Component_Names_xnames.md).
