      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how the CSM upgrade process is automated.&#xA;Overview In a nutshell, an upgrade is:&#xA;Upload new artifacts into a running system. Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images. Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded. Prerequisites Everything that is needed before upgrading an NCN.&#xA;NOTE:&#xA;The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002 (at different points in the upgrade process).</description>

      <description>Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority.</description>

      <description>About Kubernetes Taints and Labels Kubernetes labels control node affinity, which is the property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes. On the other hand, Kubernetes taints enable a node to repel a set of pods. In addition, pods can have tolerances for taints to allow them to run on nodes with certain taints.&#xA;Taints are controlled with the kubectl taint nodes command, while node labels for various nodes can be customized with a configmap that contains the desired values.</description>

      <description>Resilience of System Management Services HPE Cray EX systems are designed so that system management services (SMS) are fully resilient and that there is no single point of failure. The design of the system allows for resiliency in the following ways:&#xA;Three non-compute nodes (NCNs) are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. When one master goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes.</description>

      <description>Access control lists (ACLs) ACLs are used to help improve network performance and restrict network usage by creating policies to eliminate unwanted IP traffic by filtering packets where they enter the switch on layer 2 and layer 3 interfaces. An ACL is an ordered list of one or more access control list entries (ACEs) prioritized by sequence number. An incoming packet is matched sequentially against each entry in an ACL. When a match is made, the action of that ACE is taken and the packet is not compared against any other ACEs in the list.</description>

      <description>Broker Mode UAI Management A Broker UAI is a special kind of UAI whose job is not to host users directly but to accept attempts to reach a UAI, locate or create a UAI for the user making the attempt, and then pass the user&amp;rsquo;s connection on to the correct UAI. Multiple Broker UAIs can be created, each serving users with UAIs of a different classes. This makes it possible to set up UAIs for varying workflows and environments as needed.</description>

The operations to change these parameters are available in the Cray CLI under the scsd command.&#xA;The following are the parameters that most commonly must be set:&#xA;SSH keys IMPORTANT: If the scsd tool is used to update the SSHConsoleKey value outside of ConMan, it will disrupt the ConMan connection to the console and collection of console logs.</description>

      <description>BGP basics &amp;ldquo;The primary function of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability, from which routing loops may be pruned and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot DNS Configuration Issues Troubleshoot issues when DNS is not properly configured to delegate name resolution to the core DNS instance on a specific cluster. Although the CMN/CAN/CHN IP address may still be routable using the IP address directly, it may not work because Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway depends on the hostname (or SNI) to route traffic. For command line tools like cURL, using the --resolve option to force correct resolution can be used to work around this issue.</description>

      <description>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Basics &amp;ldquo;The primary function of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability, from which routing loops may be pruned and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.</description>

      <description>Known Issue: Ceph OSD latency On some systems, Ceph can begin to exhibit latency over time, and if this occurs it can eventually cause services like slurm and services that are backed by etcd clusters to exhibit slowness and possible timeouts. In order to determine if this is occurring, run the ceph osd perf command on a master node over a period of about ten seconds, and if an OSD consistently shows latency of above 100ms (as follows), the OSDs exhibiting this latency should be restarted:</description>

      <description>System Management Health Checks and Alerts A health check corresponds to a Prometheus query against metrics aggregated to the Prometheus instance. Core platform components like Kubernetes and Istio collect service-related metrics by default, which enables the System Management Health service to implement generic service health checks without custom instrumentation. Health checks are intended to be coarse-grained and comprehensive, as opposed to fine-grained and exhaustive. Health checks related to infrastructure adhere to the Utilization Saturation Errors (USE) method whereas services follow the Rate Errors Duration (RED) method.</description>

      <description>Hardware Management Services (HMS) Locking API The locking feature is a part of the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. The locking API enables administrators to lock components on the system. Locking components ensures other system actors, such as administrators or running services, cannot perform a firmware update with the Firmware Action Service (FAS) or a power state change with the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC). Locks only constrain FAS and CAPMC from each other and help ensure that a firmware update action will not be interfered with by a request to power off the device through CAPMC.</description>

Every component is uniquely identified by these component names. Some, like the system cabinet number or the CDU number, can be changed by site needs. There is no geolocation encoded within the cabinet number, such as an X-Y coordinate system to relate to the floor layout of the cabinets. Other component names refer to the location within a cabinet and go down to the port on a card or switch or the socket holding a processor or a memory DIMM location.</description>

      <description>Configuration Sessions Once configurations have been created with the required layers and values set in the configuration repositories (or the additional inventory repository), create a Configuration Framework Session (CFS) session to apply the configuration to the targets.&#xA;Sessions are created via the Cray CLI or through the CFS REST API. A session stages Ansible inventory (whether dynamic, static, or image customization), launches Ansible Execution Environments (AEE) in order for each configuration layer in the service mesh, tears down the environments as required, and reports the session status to the CFS API.</description>

      <description>Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Duplicate Address Warnings and Declined DHCP Offers in Logs If the DHCP and node logs show duplicate address warnings and indicate declined DHCP offers, it may be because another component owns the IP address that DHCP is trying to assign to a node. If this happens, the node will not accept the IP address and will repeatedly submit a DHCP discover request. As a result, the node and DHCP become entangled in a loop of requesting and rejecting.</description>

      <description>Known issue: kubectl logs -f returns no space left on device On some systems, running kubectl logs -n &amp;lt;NAMESPACE&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PODNAME&amp;gt; -f returns no space left on device. This can be caused by a lower limit for the sysctl setting fs.inotify.max_user_watches (defaults to 65536) in some kernel releases. This can be fixed by increasing this setting. Note that later versions of the kernel increase this setting by default.&#xA;Fix Run the following command from a master node.</description>

      <description>Known issues with NCN resource checks pods_not_running If the output of pods_not_running indicates that there are pods in the Evicted state, it may be because of the root file system being filled up on the Kubernetes node in question. Kubernetes will begin evicting pods once the root file system space is at 85% full, and will continue to evict them until it is back under 80%. This commonly happens on ncn-m001, because it is a location where install and documentation files may have been downloaded.</description>

There are three types of QoS:&#xA;Guaranteed: All containers in a pod have explicit memory and CPU resource requests and limits. For each resource, the limit equals the request.</description>

      <description>Manage Multiple Inventories in a Single Location Many configuration layers may be present in a single configuration for larger systems that configure multiple Cray products. When values for each of these layers need to be customized, it can be tedious to override values in each of the respective repositories. The CFS additionalInventoryUrl option allows for static inventory files to be automatically added to the hosts directory of each configuration layer before it is applied by Ansible.</description>

      <description>End-User UAIs UAIs used for interactive logins are called End-User UAIs. End-User UAIs can be seen as lightweight User Access Nodes (UANs), but there are important differences between UAIs and UANs.&#xA;End-User UAIs are not dedicated hardware like UANs. They are implemented as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, which makes them subject to Kubernetes scheduling and resource management rules. One key element of Kubernetes orchestration is impermanence. While End-User UAIs are often long running, Kubernetes can reschedule or recreate them as needed to meet resource and node availability constraints.</description>

The OSDs need to be reweighed to move data from the drive and get it back under the warning threshold.&#xA;When a single OSD for a pool fills up, the pool will go into read-only mode to protect the data. This can occur if the data distribution is unbalanced or if more storage nodes are needed.</description>

      <description>Track the Status of a Session A configuration session can be a long-running process, and depends on many system factors, as well as the number of configuration layers and Ansible tasks that are run in each layer. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) provides the session status through the session metadata to allow for tracking progress and session state.&#xA;Prerequisites View session status Troubleshooting Prerequisites A configuration session exists in CFS. The Cray CLI must be configured on the node where the commands are being run.</description>

      <description>Keycloak Operations A service may need to access Keycloak to perform various tasks. These typical uses for a service to access Keycloak include creating a new service account, creating a new user, etc. These operations require Keycloak administrative access. As part of the System Management Services (SMS) installation process, Keycloak is initialized with a Master realm. An administrative client and user are created within this realm. The system installation process adds the information needed for the Keycloak administrator&amp;rsquo;s authentication into a Kubernetes secret that can be accessed by any pod.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot System Clock Skew Resynchronize system clocks after Ceph reports a clock skew.&#xA;Systems use chronyd to synchronize their system clocks. If systems are not able to communicate, then the clocks can drift, causing clock skew. Clock skew can also be caused by an individual or an automated task manually changing the clocks. In this case, chronyd may require a series of steps (time adjustments) to resynchronize the clocks.&#xA;Major time jumps where the clock is set back in time will require a full restart of all Ceph services.</description>

      <description>Resource Specifications Kubernetes uses resource limits and resource requests, to manage the system resources available to pods. Because UAIs run as pods under Kubernetes, UAS takes advantage of Kubernetes to manage the system resources available to UAIs.&#xA;In the UAS configuration, resource specifications contain that configuration. A UAI that is assigned a resource specification will use that instead of the default resource limits or requests on the Kubernetes namespace containing the UAI.</description>

      <description>Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) The Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) describes a mechanism to connect multiple IP Version 4 Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) domains together. Each PIM-SM domain uses its own independent Rendezvous Point (RP) and does not have to depend on RPs in other domains. When an RP in a PIM-SM domain first learns of a new sender, e.g., via PIM register messages, it constructs a &amp;ldquo;Source-Active&amp;rdquo; (SA) message and sends it to its MSDP peers.</description>

      <description>Setting UAI Timeouts The procedures and specific values used for setting UAI timeouts are explained in the UAI Classes section. Please refer to that section.&#xA;On systems where UAIs are used as part of normal user activities, the number of UAIs can grow large. Stale UAIs (i.e. UAIs that sit idle for long periods of time) can prevent creation of fresh UAIs for users who are actually active on the system.</description>

      <description>Remove the Email Mapper from the LDAP User Federation The email mapper is automatically added to the LDAP user federation in Keycloak, but it can be removed. The system does not use the user&amp;rsquo;s email for anything, so this function can be removed.&#xA;If there are duplicate email addresses for LDAP users, it can cause Keycloak to have issues syncing with LDAP. Removing the email mapper will fix this problem.</description>

      <description>Broker UAI Resiliency and Load Balancing Broker UAI resiliency and load balancing is achieved through the use of Multi-Replica Broker UAIs. The procedures and data involved in configuring a UAI Class to create Multi-Replica Broker UAIs can be found in UAI Classes. This page describes some of the reasons to use Multi-Replica Broker UAIs and some of the implications of doing so.&#xA;When a Broker UAI runs with multiple replicas, access to the broker remains channeled through a single external IP address, but the connections are load balanced and dispatched to multiple Kubernetes pods where the Broker UAI functionality is running.</description>

      <description>Why are spine-leaf architectures becoming more popular? Given the prevalence of cloud and containerized infrastructure in modern data centers, east-west traffic continues to increase. East-west traffic moves laterally, from server to server. This shift is primarily explained by modern applications having components that are distributed across more servers or VMs.&#xA;With east-west traffic, having low-latency, optimized traffic flows is imperative for performance, especially for time-sensitive or data-intensive applications. A spine-leaf architecture aids this by ensuring traffic is always the same number of hops from its next destination, so latency is lower and predictable.</description>

      <description>Port Security Port security allows user to do the following:&#xA;Configure each switch port with a list of unique MAC addresses Limit network access to authorized MAC addresses Detect, prevent, and log unauthorized access of devices on individual ports Limit the number of MACs learned Intrusion detection enables a device to notify the user or shutdown the port in the case of a violation, and a timer can be configured to allow auto-recovery of ports shutdown in a violation state to come back up after the timer expires.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Sometimes there is no better way to figure out a problem with a UAI than to get inside it and look around as an administrator. This is done using kubectl exec to start a shell inside the running container as root (in the container). With this an administrator can diagnose problems, make changes to the running UAI, and find solutions. It is important to remember that any change made inside a UAI is transitory.</description>

      <description>Secure shell (SSH) SSH server enables an SSH client to make a secure and encrypted connection to a switch. Currently, switch supports SSH version 2.0 only. The user authentication mechanisms supported for SSH are public key authentication and password authentication (RADIUS, TACACS+ or locally stored password). Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) provides file transfer. SSH Server and sftp-client via the copy command are supported for managing the router.&#xA;Relevant Configuration</description>

      <description>Queuing and Scheduling When defining end-to-end behavior via CoS or DSCP, different priorities of traffic must be placed in different queues so the network device can service them appropriately. Separate queues allow delay- or jitter-sensitive traffic to be serviced before bulk or less time-critical traffic.&#xA;Queue policies configure which queues the different priorities of traffic will use. Queues are numbered in priority order, with zero being the lowest priority. The larger the queue number, the higher the priority of that queue.</description>

      <description>UAI Classes UAI Classes provide templates for the creation of UAIs. They permit precise configuration of the behavior, volumes, resources, and other elements of the UAI. When a UAI is created using a UAI Class, it is configured to use exactly what that UAI Class has in it at the time the UAI was created. UIA Classes permit Broker UAIs to create different kinds of UAIs based on the UAI Creation Class setting of the Broker UAI.</description>

      <description>UAI macvlans Network Attachments UAIs need to be able to reach compute nodes across the HPE Cray EX internal networks. When the compute node networks are structured as multiple subnets, this requires routing from the UAIs to those subnets. The default route in a UAI goes to the public network through the Customer Access Network (CAN) so that will not work for reaching compute nodes. To solve this problem, UAS installs Kubernetes Network Attachments within the Kubernetes user namespace.</description>

      <description>Spine-Leaf Architecture The network design used in majority of HPE Cray EX installations is spine leaf architecture. In more sizeable systems, we also utilize super-spine to accommodate the number of spines that connect the network to provide additional HA capabilities.&#xA;What is Spine-Leaf Architecture? A spine-leaf architecture is data center network topology that consists of two switching layers—a spine and leaf. The leaf layer consists of access switches that aggregate traffic from servers and connect directly into the spine or network core.</description>

Packet that ingress on a trunk port are in the VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header, or native VLAN if the packet has no 802.1Q header. A packet that egresses through a trunk port will have an 802.1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN ID. Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped.</description>

      <description>VLAN Trunking 802.1Q A trunk port carries packets on one or more VLANs specified. Packet that ingress on a trunk port are in the VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header, or native VLAN if the packet has no 802.1Q header. A packet that egresses through a trunk port will have an 802.1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN ID. Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped.</description>

      <description>Virtual Switching Framework (VSF) - 6300 Only Virtual Switching Framework (VSF) defines a virtual switch comprised of multiple individual physical switches, inter-connected through standard Ethernet links. These physical switches will operate with one control plane, thereby visible to the peers as a virtual switch stack.&#xA;Within the stack, one switch is the &amp;ldquo;Master&amp;rdquo; switch, which runs all the control plane software and manages the ASICs of all the stack members. A second switch can be configured as the &amp;ldquo;Standby&amp;rdquo; switch, which will take over as master if the master fails.</description>

      <description>Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) Aruba&amp;rsquo;s Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) is a solution that integrates two independent ArubaOS-CX switches into an active/active virtualized high availability (HA) solution. The two switch peers utilize a connected link for control and data. This solution allows the switches to present as one virtualized switch in critical areas.&#xA;Configuration synchronization is one aspect of this VSX solution where the primary switch configuration is synced to the secondary switch.</description>

      <description>What is VSX? Enterprise networks face the challenge of delivering 24x7 always-on reliable access and cloud-based services. As a business and network grows, this non-stop availability becomes more critical due to simple economics. Downtime leads to a loss of productivity, user satisfaction and revenue.&#xA;Switches in the campus and data center sit at the heart of the network and are responsible for the delivery of a high availability (HA) solution that is capable of ensuring always-on access with robust performance.</description>

      <description>Switch Replacement in the VSX Cluster Replace the VSX primary or the VSX secondary with the following steps.&#xA;Make sure all cables are labelled with clear identification. Unplug power and all fibers and copper cables. Un-rack the failing unit and rack the replacement unit. Power-up the unit. Restore switch firmware (see note below) and configuration. SSH/Console to the replacement switch and shutdown all ports. Example: 8320, 8325 config Switch(config)# interface 1/1/1-1/1/52 shutdown NOTE Restoring firmware is required only if replacing the primary VSX member.</description>

      <description>VSX Sync Configuration synchronization is one aspect of this VSX solution where the primary switch configuration is synced to the secondary switch. This allows for pseudo single pane of glass configuration and helps keep key configuration pieces in sync as operational changes are made. Since the solution is primarily for HA, it is expected that the vast majority of configuration policy is the same across both peers.&#xA;Configuration Commands Synchronize VLANs:</description>
