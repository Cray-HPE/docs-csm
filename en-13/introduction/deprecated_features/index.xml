      <description>CAPMC Deprecation Notice Many CAPMC v1 REST API and CLI features are being deprecated as of CSM version 1.0. Full removal of the following deprecated CAPMC features will happen in a future CSM release. Further development of CAPMC service and CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release. The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC is being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS.</description>
