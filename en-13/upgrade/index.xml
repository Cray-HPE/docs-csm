      <description>Stage 4 - Ceph Upgrade Important: Ceph does not need to be upgraded if this is an upgrade is staying within a CSM release, e.g. CSM-1.3.0-rc1 to CSM-1.3.0-rc2. If this is an upgrade staying within a CSM release, then Ceph is already running v16.2.9. See instructions in stage completed for next steps.&#xA;Reminder: If any problems are encountered and the procedure or command output does not provide relevant guidance, then see Relevant troubleshooting links for upgrade-related issues.</description>

      <description>CSM 1.2.0 or later to 1.3.0 Upgrade Process Introduction This document guides an administrator through the upgrade of Cray Systems Management from version 1.2 to version 1.3. When upgrading a system, follow this top-level file from top to bottom. The content on this top-level page is meant to be terse. For additional reference material on the upgrade processes and scripts mentioned explicitly on this page, see resource material.&#xA;Important notes Service request adjustments are needed for small systems For systems with only three worker nodes (typically Testing and Development Systems (TDS)), prior to proceeding with this upgrade, CPU limits MUST be lowered on several services in order for this upgrade to succeed.</description>
