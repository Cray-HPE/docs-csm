> This page will receive updates, but for now see this confluence article: https://connect.us.cray.com/confluence/display/MTL/NCN+Partition+Scheme

## Partition Layout

- **Ephemeral**: a disk that is not in the systems RAID
- **BOOTRAID**: a RAID disk device in the system

| FS Label | Partitions | Nodes	| Device | Size on Disk | Work Order | Memo
| --- | --- | ---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SQFSRAID` | `/squashfs_management` | All NCNs | `BOOTRAID (MIRROR)` | `100 GiB` | [CASM-1885](https://connect.us.cray.com/jira/browse/MTL-1885) |  squashfs should compress our images to about 1/3rd their uncompressed size. (20G â†’ 6.6G)  On pepsi's ncn-w001, we're at ~20G of non-volatile data storage needed. |
| `ROOTRAID` | `/` | All NCNs | `BOOTRAID (MIRROR)` | Max/Remainder | Present since Shasta-Preview 1 | Partitions from 1.3 are not currently mounted. |
| `BOOTRAID` |	`/boot/efi` | All NCNs | `BOOTRAID (MIRROR)` | `500 MiB` | Present since Shasta-Preview 1 |
| `CONRUN` | `/run/containerd` | All K8s Managers & Workers | Ephemeral | `75 GiB` | [MTL-916](https://connect.us.cray.com/jira/browse/MTL-916) | On pepsi ncn-w001, we have less than 200G of operational storage for this. |
