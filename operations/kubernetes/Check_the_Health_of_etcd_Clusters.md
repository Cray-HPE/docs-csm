# Check the Health of etcd Clusters

Check to see if all of the etcd clusters have the correct number of healthy pods and a healthy cluster database.
Any clusters that do not have healthy pods will need to be either restored from backup or rebuilt.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires root privileges.

## Procedure

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the health of the clusters.

    To check the health of the etcd clusters in the services namespace without TLS authentication:

    ```bash
    /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s etcd_health_status
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    **************************************************************************

    === Check the Health of the Etcd Clusters in all Namespaces. ===
    === Verify a "healthy" Report for Each Etcd Pod. ===

    ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-0 ###
    127.0.0.1:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 4.166761ms
    ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-1 ###
    127.0.0.1:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 4.697124ms
    ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-2 ###
    127.0.0.1:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 4.119712ms
    [...]
     --- PASSED ---
    ```

    If any of the etcd clusters are not healthy, refer to [Restore an etcd Cluster from a Backup](Restore_an_etcd_Cluster_from_a_Backup.md).

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the number of pods in each cluster.

    Each cluster should contain at least three pods.

    ```bash
    /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s etcd_cluster_balance
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    **************************************************************************
    
    === Check the Number of Pods in Each Cluster. Verify they are Balanced. ===
    === Each cluster should contain at least three pods, but may contain more. ===
    === Ensure that no two pods in a given cluster exist on the same worker node. ===

    cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-0                                           2/2     Running     0          22h     10.32.0.76    ncn-w002   <none>           <none>
    cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-1                                           2/2     Running     0          22h     10.40.0.8     ncn-w003   <none>           <none>
    cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-2                                           2/2     Running     0          22h     10.44.0.58    ncn-w001   <none>           <none>
    [...]
     --- PASSED ---
    ```

    If the etcd clusters have fewer than three pods in a 'Running' state, see [Restore an etcd Cluster from a Backup](Restore_an_etcd_Cluster_from_a_Backup.md).

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the health of all etcd clusters' databases:

   ```bash
   /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh -s etcd_database_health
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   **************************************************************************

   === Check the health of Etcd Cluster's database in the Services Namespace. ===
   === PASS or FAIL status returned. ===
   ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-0 Etcd Database Check: ###
   PASS: OK foo fooCheck 1
   ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-1 Etcd Database Check: ###
   PASS: OK foo fooCheck 1
   ### cray-bos-bitnami-etcd-2 Etcd Database Check: ###
   PASS: OK foo fooCheck 1
   [...]
    --- PASSED ---
   ```

   If any of the etcd cluster databases are not healthy, then refer to the following procedures:

   - [Check for and Clear etcd Cluster Alarms](Check_for_and_Clear_etcd_Cluster_Alarms.md)
   - [Clear Space in an etcd Cluster Database](Clear_Space_in_an_etcd_Cluster_Database.md)
