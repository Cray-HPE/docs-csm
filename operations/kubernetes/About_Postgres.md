## About Postgres

The system uses PostgreSQL \(known as Postgres\) as a database solution. Postgres databases use SQL language to store and manage databases on the system.

To learn more about Postgres, see [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

The Patroni tool can be used to manage and maintain information in a Postgres database. It handles tasks such as listing cluster members and the replication status, configuring and restarting databases, and more. For more information about this tool, refer to [Troubleshoot Postgres Database](Troubleshoot_Postgres_Database.md).
