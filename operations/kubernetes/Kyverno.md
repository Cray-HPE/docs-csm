# Kyverno policy management

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is a policy engine designed specifically for Kubernetes.

Kyverno allows cluster administrators to manage environment-specific configurations (independently of workload configurations) and enforce configuration best practices for their clusters.

Kyverno can be used to scan existing workloads for best practices, or it can be used to enforce best practices by blocking or mutating API requests.

Kyverno enables administrators to do the following:

* Manage policies as Kubernetes resources.
* Validate, mutate, and generate resource configurations.
* Select resources based on labels and wildcards.
* Block nonconforming resources using admission controls, or report policy violations.
* View policy enforcement as events.
* Scan existing resources for violations.

Kyverno policies implement the various levels of Kubernetes [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) for CSM services.

The policies are minimally restrictive and enforce the best practices for pods. The policies make sure that the following values are set for workloads (if not present):

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  privileged: false
  runAsUser: 65534
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsGroup: 65534
```

[Mutation](#mutation) and [Validation](#validation) policies are enforced for the network services such as load balancer and virtual service.

## Mutation

Mutation policies are applied in the admission controller while creating pods.

It mutates the manifest of respective workloads before creating them so that when the resource comes up, it will abide by the policy constraints.

### Example mutation policy

1. Create a policy definition.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
    kind: Policy
    metadata:
      name: add-default-securitycontext
    spec:
    rules:
      - name: set-container-security-context
        match:
          resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: nginx
        mutate:
          patchStrategicMerge:
            spec:
              containers:
              - (name): "*"
                securityContext:
                  +(allowPrivilegeEscalation): false
                  +(privileged): false
    ```

1. Create a simple pod definition.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) List all of the policies with the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pol -A
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAMESPACE            NAME                        BACKGROUND   ACTION   READY
    default              add-default-securitycontext true         audit    true
    ```

1. Check the manifest after applying the policy.

    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.14.2
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 10m
            memory: 64Mi
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          privileged: false
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        terminationMessagePolicy: File
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
          name: default-token-vgggw
          readOnly: true
    ```

1. Edit the policy to add one more field and apply the policy again.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
    kind: Policy
    metadata:
      name: add-default-securitycontext
    spec:
    rules:
      - name: set-container-security-context
        match:
          resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: nginx
        mutate:
          patchStrategicMerge:
            spec:
              containers:
              - (name): "*"
                securityContext:
                  +(allowPrivilegeEscalation): false
                  +(privileged): false
                  +(runAsNonRoot): true
    ```

    If any of the workloads fail to come up after enforcing the policy, then delete the individual policies and restart the workload.

1. Check the pod description when the pod fails to come up.

    1. (`ncn-mw#`) Obtain the pod name.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        NAME    READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS   AGE
        nginx   0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0          5s
        ```

    1. (`ncn-mw#`) Describe the pod.

        ```bash
        kubectl describe pod nginx
        ```

        End of example output:

        ```text
        Events:
        Type     Reason            Age                            From               Message

        ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) If the previous step failed, then delete the policy and restart the workload.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pol -n default add-default-securitycontext
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the pod status after deleting the policy.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx   1/1     Running   0          6s
    ```

## Validation

Validation policies can be applied any time in `audit` and `enforce` modes.

In the case of `audit` mode, violations are only reported. In `enforce` mode, the resources are blocked from coming up.

Also, it generates the report of policy violation in respective workloads. The following is an example of the validation policy in `audit` mode.

### Example validation policy

1. Add the following policy before applying the [mutation](#mutation) to the workload.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
    kind: Policy
    metadata:
      name: validate-securitycontext
    spec:
      background: true
      validationFailureAction: audit
      rules:
      - name: container-security-context
        match:
          resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: nginx
        validate:
          message: "Non root security context is not set."
          pattern:
            spec:
              containers:
              - (name): "*"
                securityContext:
                  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
                  privileged: false
    ```

    * (`ncn-mw#`) View the policy report status with the following command:

        ```bash
        kubectl get polr -A
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        NAMESPACE  NAME                   PASS   FAIL   WARN   ERROR   SKIP   AGE
        default    polr-ns-default        0      1      0      0       0      25d
        ```

    * (`ncn-mw#`) View a detailed policy report with the following command:

        ```bash
        kubectl get polr -n default polr-ns-default -o yaml
        ```

        Example output:

        ```yaml
        results:
        - message: 'validation error: Non root security context is not set. Rule container-security-context failed at path /spec/containers/0/securityContext/'
          policy: validate-securitycontext
          resources:
          - apiVersion: v1
            kind: Pod
            name: nginx
            namespace: default
            uid: 319e5b09-6027-4d90-b3da-6aa1f14573ff
          result: fail
          rule: container-security-context
          scored: true
          source: Kyverno
          timestamp:
            nanos: 0
            seconds: 1654594319
          summary:
            error: 0
            fail: 1
            pass: 0
            skip: 0
            warn: 0
        ```

1. Apply the mutation policy and restart the following workload.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the policy report status.

    ```bash
    kubectl get polr -A
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAMESPACE  NAME                   PASS   FAIL   WARN   ERROR   SKIP   AGE
    default    polr-ns-default        1      0      0      0       0      25d
    ```

    This shows that the mutation policy for the workload was enforced properly.

    If there are any discrepancies, look at the detailed policy report to triage the issue.
## What is new in HPE CSM v1.4

As part of HPE CSM v1.4, the upstream Baseline profile is made available for the customer.

The Baseline profile is a collection of policies which implement the various levels of Kubernetes [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).

The Baseline profile is minimally restrictive and denies the most common vulnerabilities. It also follows many of the common security best practices for Pods.

[Baseline profile](https://github.com/kyverno/policies/tree/main/pod-security/baseline) consists of 12 policies as listed below. 

    ```bash
    kubectl get clusterpolicy -A
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME                             BACKGROUND   ACTION   READY
    cluster-job-ttl                  true         audit    true
    disallow-capabilities            true         audit    true
    disallow-host-namespaces         true         audit    true
    disallow-host-path               true         audit    true
    disallow-host-ports              true         audit    true
    disallow-host-process            true         audit    true
    disallow-privileged-containers   true         audit    true
    disallow-proc-mount              true         audit    true
    disallow-selinux                 true         audit    true
    restrict-apparmor-profiles       true         audit    true
    restrict-seccomp                 true         audit    true
    restrict-sysctls                 true         audit    true
    ```
The violations for each of the baseline policy is logged in policyreport, similar to other policies as mentioned in Validation section above.
In order to give more insights towards each violation use below mentioned command.

### Example to list policy violations at pod level.

    ```bash
    kubectl get polr -A -o json | jq -r -c '["Name","kind","Namespace","policy","message"],(.items[].results // [] | map(select(.result=="fail")) | select(. | length > 0) | .[] | select (.resources[0].kind == "Pod") | [.resources[0].name,.resources[0].kind,.resources[0].namespace,.policy,.message]) | @csv'
    ```

    Example output: 

    ```text
    "Name","kind","Namespace","policy","message"
    "hms-discovery-28031310-lnvtf","Pod","services","disallow-capabilities","Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER, FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT) are disallowed."

    ```

### Example to list all the policy violations.
	
    ```bash
    kubectl get polr -A -o json | jq -r -c '["Name","kind","Namespace","policy","message"],(.items[].results // [] | map(select(.result=="fail")) | select(. | length > 0) | .[] | select (.resources[0].kind) | [.resources[0].name,.resources[0].kind,.resources[0].namespace,.policy,.message]) | @csv'
