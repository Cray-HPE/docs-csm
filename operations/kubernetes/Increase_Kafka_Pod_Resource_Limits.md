# Increase Kafka Pod Resource Limits

For larger scale systems, the Kafka resource limits may need to be increased. See [Increase Pod Resource Limits](Increase_Pod_Resource_Limits.md) for details on how to increase limits. 

**Increase Kafka Resource Limits Example**

For a 1500 compute node system, increasing the cpu count to 6 and memory limits to 128G should be adequate.
