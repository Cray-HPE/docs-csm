# Repopulate Data in etcd Clusters When Rebuilding Them

When an etcd cluster is not healthy, it needs to be rebuilt. During that process, the pods that rely on etcd clusters lose data.
That data needs to be repopulated in order for the cluster to go back to a healthy state.

The following services need their data repopulated in the etcd cluster:

- Boot Orchestration Service \(BOS\)
- Boot Script Service \(BSS\)
- Content Projection Service \(CPS\)
- Compute Rolling Upgrade Service \(CRUS\)
- External DNS
- Firmware Action Service \(FAS\)
- HMS Notification Fanout Daemon \(HMNFD\)
- Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service \(MEDS\)
- River Endpoint Discovery Service \(REDS\)

## Prerequisites

An etcd cluster was rebuilt. See [Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters](Rebuild_Unhealthy_etcd_Clusters.md).

## BOS

1. Reconstruct boot session templates for impacted product streams to repopulate data.

    Boot preparation information for other product streams can be found in the following locations:

    - UANs: Refer to the UAN product stream repository and search for the "PREPARE UAN BOOT SESSION TEMPLATES" header in the "Install and Configure UANs" procedure.
    - Cray Operating System \(COS\): Refer to the "Create a Boot Session Template" header in the "Boot COS" procedure in the COS product stream documentation.

## CPS

Repopulate clusters for CPS.

- If there are no clients using CPS when the etcd cluster is rebuilt, then nothing needs to be done other than to rebuild the cluster and make sure all of the components are up and running.
  See [Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters](Rebuild_Unhealthy_etcd_Clusters.md) for more information.
- If any clients have already mounted content provided by CPS, that content should be unmounted before rebuilding the etcd cluster, and then re-mounted after the etcd cluster is rebuilt.
  Compute nodes that use CPS to access their root file system must be shut down to unmount, and then booted to perform the re-mount.

## CRUS

**Note:** CRUS is deprecated in CSM 1.2.0. It will be removed in a future CSM release and replaced with BOS V2, which will provide similar functionality. See
[Deprecated features](../../introduction/differences.md#deprecated_features).

1. View the progress of existing CRUS sessions.

    1. List the existing CRUS sessions to find the `upgrade_id` for the desired session.

        ```bash
        ncn# cray crus session list
        ```

        Example output:

        ```toml
        [[results]]
        api_version = "1.0.0"
        completed = false
        failed_label = "failed-nodes"
        kind = "ComputeUpgradeSession"
        messages = [ "Quiesce requested in step 0: moving to QUIESCING", "All nodes quiesced in step 0: moving to QUIESCED", "Began the boot session for step 0: moving to BOOTING",]
        starting_label = "slurm-nodes"
        state = "UPDATING"
        upgrade_id = "e0131663-dbee-47c2-aa5c-13fe9b110242" <<-- Note this value
        upgrade_step_size = 50
        upgrade_template_id = "boot-template"
        upgrading_label = "upgrading-nodes"
        workload_manager_type = "slurm"
        ```

    1. Describe the CRUS session to see if the session failed or is stuck.

        If the session continued and appears to be in a healthy state, proceed to the [BSS](#bss) section.

        ```bash
        ncn# cray crus session describe CRUS_UPGRADE_ID
        ```

        Example output:

        ```toml
        api_version = "1.0.0"
        completed = false
        failed_label = "failed-nodes"
        kind = "ComputeUpgradeSession"
        messages = [ "Quiesce requested in step 0: moving to QUIESCING", "All nodes quiesced in step 0: moving to QUIESCED", "Began the boot session for step 0: moving to BOOTING",]
        starting_label = "slurm-nodes"
        state = "UPDATING"
        upgrade_id = "e0131663-dbee-47c2-aa5c-13fe9b110242"
        upgrade_step_size = 50
        upgrade_template_id = "boot-template"
        upgrading_label = "upgrading-nodes"
        workload_manager_type = "slurm"
        ```

1. Find the name of the running CRUS pod.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl get pods -n services | grep cray-crus
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    cray-crus-549cb9cb5d-jtpqg                                   3/4     Running   528        25h
    ```

1. Restart the CRUS pod.

    Deleting the pod will restart CRUS and start the discovery process for any data recovered in etcd.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl delete pods -n services POD_NAME
    ```

## BSS

Data is repopulated in BSS when the REDS `init` job is run.

1. Get the current REDS job.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl get -o json -n services job/cray-reds-init |
            jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels["controller-uid"], .spec.selector)' > cray-reds-init.json
    ```


1. Delete the `reds-client-init` job.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl delete -n services -f cray-reds-init.json
    ```


1. Restart the `reds-client-init` job.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl apply -n services -f cray-reds-init.json
    ```

## REDS

1. Restart REDS.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl -n services delete pods --selector='app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-reds'
    ```

## MEDS

1. Restart MEDS.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl -n services delete pods --selector='app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-meds'
    ```

## FAS

1. Reload the firmware images from Nexus.

  Refer to the `Load Firmware from Nexus` section in [FAS Admin Procedures](../firmware/FAS_Admin_Procedures.md#load-firmware-from-nexus) for more information.

  When the etcd cluster is rebuilt, all historic data for firmware actions and all recorded snapshots will be lost.
  Image data will be reloaded from Nexus.
  Any images that were loaded into FAS outside of Nexus will need to be reloaded using the `Load Firmware from RPM or ZIP file` section in [FAS Admin Procedures](../firmware/FAS_Admin_Procedures.md#load-firmware-from-rpm-or-zip-file).
  After images are reloaded, any running actions at time of failure will need to be recreated.

## HMNFD

1. Resubscribe the compute nodes and any NCNs that use the ORCA daemon for their State Change Notifications \(SCN\).

    1. Resubscribe all compute nodes.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# TMPFILE=$(mktemp)
      ncn-m001# sat status --no-borders --no-headings | grep Ready | grep Compute | awk '{printf("nid%06d-nmn\n",$3);}' > $TMPFILE
      ncn-m001# pdsh -w ^${TMPFILE} "systemctl restart cray-dvs-orca"
      ncn-m001# rm -rf $TMPFILE
      ```

    1. Resubscribe the NCNs.

        **NOTE:** Modify the `-w` arguments in the following commands to reflect the number of worker and storage nodes in the system.

        ```bash
        ncn-m001# pdsh -w ncn-w00[0-4]-can.local "systemctl restart cray-dvs-orca"
        ncn-m001# pdsh -w ncn-s00[0-4]-can.local "systemctl restart cray-dvs-orca"
        ```
