# Disabling VLAN7 for UANs (placeholder)

## Summary

After updating to CSM 1.2, the UAN nodes need to have their access to the CMN (VLAN7) removed.  This access must be restricted by removing VLAN7 from the UAN switch ports.

## Procedure (placeholder)

This procedure is currently being tested but is not available today.  This page will be updated in the future once the full procedure for removing VLAN7 from the UAN switch ports has been validated.
