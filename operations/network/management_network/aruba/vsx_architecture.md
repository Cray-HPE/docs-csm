# What is VSX?

Enterprise networks face the challenge of delivering 24x7 always-on reliable access and cloud-based services. As a business and network grows, this non-stop availability becomes more critical due to simple economics. Downtime leads to a loss of productivity, user satisfaction and revenue.

Switches in the campus and data center sit at the heart of the network and are responsible for the delivery of a high availability (HA) solution that’s capable of ensuring always-on access with robust performance.

To address this requirement, Aruba’s Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) has been designed from the ground up to provide industry-leading performance and high availability with much-needed simplicity. This is accomplished through the resiliency of AOS-CX, a modern network operating system that performs continuous state synchronization.
