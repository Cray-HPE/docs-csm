* Hardware Management Network (HMN) - Provides internal access to system baseboard management controllers (BMC/iLO) and other lower-level hardware access

External and Edge Networks:

* Customer Management Network (CMN) - Provides customer access from the site to the system for administrators
* Customer Access Network (CAN) or Customer High Speed Network (CHN) provide:
	* Customer access from the site to the system for job control and jobs data movement
	* Access from the System to the Site for network services like DNS, LDAP, and more
