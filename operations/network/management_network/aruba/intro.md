# Introduction

The intent for the this documentation is to help install and manage Aruba CX network devices in an HPE Cray EX system installation.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is with the CANU tool. Thus, this guide will not go to into a level of detail of how to configure each switch with the CLI in the topology. However, it will provide examples of how to configure and use features generated by CANU to provide administrators with an easy way to customize their installation.

This guide also includes the current documented and supported network scenarios.

> **NOTE:** Not every configuration option is covered here, and for any configuration outside of the scope of this document, refer to the official Aruba user manuals.

Aruba documentation and software can be found from:

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.
