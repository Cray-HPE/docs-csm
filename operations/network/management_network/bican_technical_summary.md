## BICAN features

- Bifurcation or splitting of the Customer Access Network (CAN) enables customization of customer traffic to and from the system.
Customization will be performed during installation.
In CSM 1.2, as part of the process to split the existing monolithic CAN, two new customer access networks are introduced:
  - High Speed Customer Access - CHN: This feature adds the ability to connect to Application Nodes (UAN), UAI, Compute Nodes,
and Kubernetes API endpoints from the customer site via the High Speed Network (HSN).
  - Management Customer Access - CMN:  Using a new VLAN on the Management Network, this feature allows system administrative access from the customer site.
Administrative access was previously available on the original CAN; this feature provides a traffic path and access split.
