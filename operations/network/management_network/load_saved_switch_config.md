# Load Saved Switch Configuration

This procedure shows how to switch between already saved switch configurations.

To save switch configurations, refer to the [Configuration Management](config_management.md) procedure.

This procedure is intended for internal use only. It is used to quickly switch between configurations that are already loaded on the switches.

This procedure needs to be done on all mgmt switches.

-  Spine switches will have three total configuration files/checkpoints.
    -  1.2 fresh install
    -  1.2 upgrade
    -  1.0
  
-  Leaf-BMC switches will have have two configuration files/checkpoints.
    - 1.2
    - 1.0
  
### Aruba

1. View the checkpoints. 
   
    Ensure that the proper checkpoints exist. `CSM1_0` and `CSM1_2` are used in this example.

    Example:

    ```
    sw-spine-001# show checkpoint | include CSM
    CSM1_2_FRESH_INSTALL_CANU_1_3_2                     latest      User    2022-04-01T20:11:57Z  GL.10.09.0010
    CSM1_2_UPGRADE_CANU_1_3_2                           checkpoint  User    2022-04-01T18:57:06Z  GL.10.09.0010
    CSM1_0_CANU_1_2_4                                   checkpoint  User    2022-03-15T21:37:11Z  GL.10.09.0010
    ```

2. Rollback to desired checkpoint.

    ```
    sw-spine-001# checkpoint rollback CSM1_2_UPGRADE_CANU_1_3_2    
    ```

### Dell

1. View the configuration files.
   
    Ensure that the proper config files exist. In this example we will be using `CSM1_0` and `CSM1_2`

    ```
    sw-leaf-001# dir config
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    Directory contents for folder: config
    Date (modified)        Size (bytes)  Name
    ---------------------  ------------  ------------------------------------------
    2022-02-08T16:31:42Z   112189        csm1.0.xml
    2022-02-08T16:28:31Z   112189        csm1.2.xml
    2022-02-08T16:30:23Z   112189        startup.xml
    ```

2. Copy the desired configuration to the startup configuration.

    ```
    sw-leaf-001# copy config://csm1.0.xml config://startup.xml
    ```

    `Copy completed` will be returned if successful.

3. Reboot the switch without saving configuration.
    
    ```
    sw-leaf-001# reload
    System configuration has been modified. Save? [yes/no]:no
    ```

### Mellanox

1. View the configuration files.
   
    Ensure that the proper checkpoints exist. In this example we will be using `CSM1_0` and `CSM1_2`

    ```
    sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # show configuration files
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    sw-spine-001 [mlag-domain: master] # show configuration files

    csm1.0.canu1.1.21 (active)
    csm1.0.canu1.1.21.bak
    csm1.2.fresh_install_canu1.1.21
    csm1.2.fresh_install_canu1.1.21.bak
    csm1.2.upgrade_canu1.1.21
    csm1.2.upgrade_canu1.1.21.bak
    initial
    initial.bak

    Active configuration: csm1.0.canu1.1.21
    Unsaved changes     : yes
    ```

2. Switch to desired configuration.

    ```
    sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # configuration switch-to csm1.2.upgrade_canu1.1.21
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    This requires a reboot.
    Type 'yes' to confirm: yes
    ```

The switch will then reboot to chosen configuration.
