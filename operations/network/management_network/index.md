# HPE Cray EX Management Network Installation and Configuration Guide

The intent for the this documentation is to help install and manage Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox network switches in an HPE Cray EX system installation.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is with the CANU tool. Thus, this guide will not go to into a level of detail of how to configure each switch with the CLI in the topology. However, it will provide examples of how to configure and use features generated by CANU to provide administrators with an easy way to customize their installation.

This guide also includes the current documented and supported network scenarios.

> **NOTE:** Not every configuration option is covered here, and for any configuration outside of the scope of this document, refer to the official Aruba user manuals.

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.

In the Shasta management network version 1.2 Spanning-tree configuration 
is changing from RPVST (RSTP) to MSTP to allow for better vendor interoperability
and simplified Spanning-tree configuration. New default configuration: 

* Spanning-tree BPDU guard is removed from NCN LAG ports
* Spanning-tree BPDU filter is removed
* Spanning-tree admin-edge port settings are retained for allowing quicker PXE boot
* Spanning-tree instance is tied to default (no longer multiple instances or per vlan) 
* Spanning-tree MSTP configuration name and revision in all configurations generated by Canu are set as: ***name*** cray ***version*** 2
