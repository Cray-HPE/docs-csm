# Management Network User Guide

This documentation helps network administrators and support personnel install install and manage Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox network devices in a CSM install.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is by using the CANU tool. Therefore this guide will not go into detail on how to configure each
switch manually using the CLI. Instead, it will give helpful examples of how to configure/use features generated by CANU, in order to provide administrators
easy ways to customize their installation.

Also included in this guide are the current documented and supported network scenarios.

**NOTE:** Not every configuration option is covered here; for any configuration outside of the scope of this document, refer to the official
Aruba, Dell, or Mellanox user manuals.

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.

**NOTE:** The display and command lines illustrated in this document are examples and might not exactly match any particular environment. The switch and
accessory drawings in this document are for illustration only, and may not exactly match installed products.

## Switch Configuration States

To check the current state of the switches, see the [upgrade](upgrade.md) page.

* `1.0 Config`: Non-generated switch configurations
* `1.2 Preconfig`: CANU-generated configurations for 1.0
* `1.2 Config`: CANU-generated configurations for 1.2

<a name="starting"></a>

## Starting Points

* Current switch configurations are not generated and need to upgrade to generated configurations.
  * This can either be 1.0 generated or 1.2 generated.
  * [upgrade](upgrade.md)
* Current switch configurations are generated and need to go to 1.2.
  * [`1.2 (Preconfig)` to 1.2](1.0_to_1.2_upgrade.md)
* Switches have no configuration on them.
  * [Fresh Install](fresh_install.md)
* Reinstalling the same CSM version.
  * [Re-install](reinstall.md)
* New hardware was added to the system.
  * [Added Hardware](added_hardware.md)
* Switch failed and needs to be replaced.
  * [Replace Switch](replace_switch.md)

### Enhancements

Software enhancements are listed in reverse-chronological order, with the newest on the top of the list.

Unless otherwise noted, each network version listed includes all enhancements added in earlier versions.

#### Spanning-tree

In the Shasta management network version 1.2, Spanning-tree configuration is changing from RPVST (RSTP) to
MSTP, in order to allow for better vendor interoperability and simplified Spanning-tree configuration. The
new default configuration is as follows:

* Spanning-tree BPDU guard is removed from NCN LAG ports.
* Spanning-tree BPDU filter is removed.
* Spanning-tree admin-edge port settings are retained for allowing quicker PXE boot.
* Spanning-tree instance is tied to default (no longer multiple instances or per VLAN).
* Spanning-tree MSTP configuration name and revision in all configurations generated by CANU are set.
* Add peering from MetalLB to customer edge router.

### Security Bulletin Subscription Service

To initiate a subscription to receive future HPE Security Bulletin alerts via email,
see the [HPE Support Center](https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/?language=en_US).

A Security Bulletin is the published notification of security vulnerabilities and is the only communication
vehicle for security vulnerabilities.

* Fixes for security vulnerabilities are not documented in manuals, release notes, or other forms of product
documentation.
* A Security Bulletin is released when all vulnerable products still in support life have publicly available
images that contain the fix for the security vulnerability.
