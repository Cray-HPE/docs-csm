# Validate the SHCD

Use the CSM Automated Network Utility (CANU) to validate the SHCD. SHCD validation is required to ensure Plan-of-Record network configurations are generated. This is an iterative process to create a model of the entire network topology connection by connection.

## Prerequisites

- Up-to-date SHCD.
- CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.
  - Run `canu --version` to see version.
  - If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see [Update CANU From CSM Tarball](canu/update_canu_from_csm_tarball.md).

## Validation steps

1. Validate the `10G_25G_40G_100G` tab and select the upper left corner and lower right corner of the spreadsheet with the `Source Rack Location Slot Port Destination Rack Location Port` information.

   This is a block of data on the right hand of the worksheet and is not the calculated values used for cable labels on the left-hand side.

   ![SHCD example](img/shcd_example.png "SHCD example")

   In this example above, the `10G_25G_40G_100G` worksheet has the upper left and lower right corners of `I37` and `T107` respectively.
   Note, the above screenshot is trimmed and only the first full 68 rows are shown.

1. (`pit#`) Generate the HMN paddle file (by default this runs in interactive mode to select the tabs and corners).

   > **`NOTE`**
   > `-a` defines the architecture, this will be:
   >
   > - `v1` if the HPE Cray EX system is composed of Mellanox and Dell switches, typically with Gigabyte or Intel server hardware.
   > - `tds` if the Cray system has Aruba switches with HPE servers **and NCNs are connected to the Aruba Spine switches**.
   > - `full` if the Cray system has Aruba switches with HPE servers **and NCNs are connected to the Aruba Leaf switches**.

   ```bash
   ARCH=v1
   ```

   > **`NOTE`** The `canu` command below will start interactive mode for defining `--corners`. If
   > the `--corners` are already known, then append `--corners` with the desired corners to bypass interactive mode.

   ```bash
   canu validate shcd --json --out "${SYSTEM_NAME}-hmn-paddle.json" --tabs HMN -a "${ARCH}" --shcd <shcd_file.xlsx>
   ```

1. (`pit#`) Generate the full paddle file (by default the command below will run in interactive mode.)

   > **`NOTE`** The `canu` command below will start interactive mode for defining `--corners`. If
   > the `--corners` are already known, then append `--corners` with the desired corners to bypass interactive mode.

   ```bash
   canu validate shcd --json --out "${SYSTEM_NAME}-full-paddle.json" -a "${ARCH}" --shcd <shcd_file>.xlsx
   ```

   > **`NOTE`** CANU will ensure that each cell has valid data and that the connections between devices are allowed. Errors will stop processing and must be fixed in
   > the spreadsheet before moving on. A "clean run" through a worksheet will include the model, a port-map of each node and may include warnings. See a
   > list of typical errors at the end of this document to help in fixing the worksheet data.

1. Proceed to [generate topology files](../../../install/pre-installation.md#generate-topology-files).

## Under the hood

A worksheet that runs *cleanly* will have checked that:

- Nodes are *architecturally allowed* to connect to each other.
- No overlapping ports specified.
- Node connections can be made at the appropriate speeds.

In addition, a clean run will have the following sections:

- SHCD Node Connections – A high level list of all node connections on the system.
- SHCD Port Usage – A Port-by-port detailed listing of all node connections on the system.
- Warnings:
  - A list of nodes found that are not categorized on the system.

    **`NOTE`** This list is important as it could include misspellings of nodes that should be included!

  - A list of cell-by-cell warnings of misspellings and other nit-picking items that CANU has autocorrected on the system.

### Check warnings

**Critical:** The `Warnings` output will contain a section headed `Node type could not be determined for the following`. This needs to
be carefully reviewed because it may contain site uplinks that are not tracked by CANU, and may also contain misspelled or miscategorized
nodes.

For example:

```text
Node type could not be determined for the following.

These nodes are not currently included in the model.

(This may be a missing architectural definition/lookup or a spelling error)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheet: 10G_25G_40G_100G
Cell: I96      Name: CAN switch
Cell: I97      Name: CAN switch
Cell: O87      Name: CAN switch
Cell: O90      Name: CAN switch
Cell: O93      Name: CAN switch
Cell: O100     Name: CAN switch
Cell: O103     Name: CAN switch
Cell: I38      Name: sw-spinx-002

Sheet: HMN
Cell: R36      Name: SITE

Sheet: NMN
Cell: P16      Name: SITE
```

**From the above example, two important observations can be made:**

1. CAN and SITE uplinks are not in the "clean run" model. This means that these ports will not be configured.

1. Critically, cell `I38` has a name of `sw-spinx-002`. This should be noted as a misspelling of `sw-spine-002` and corrected.

### Check SHCD port usage

Today CANU validates many things, but a future feature is full cable specification checking of nodes (e.g. which NCN ports go to
which switches to properly form bonds). There are several CANU roadmap items, but today a manual review of the `SHCD Port Usage`
connections list is vital. Specifically, check:

- Both Management NCNs (manager, worker, storage) and UAN NCNs (UAN, viz, and other Application Nodes) follow Plan of Record (PoR)
  cabling. See [Cable Management Network Servers](cable_management_network_servers.md).

- Switch pair cabling is appropriate for VSX, MAGP, etc.

- Switch-to-switch cabling is appropriate for LAG formation.

- **Other** nodes on the network seem sane.

## Logging and updates

Once the SHCD has run cleanly through CANU and CANU output has been manually validated, changes to the SHCD should be
*committed* so that work is not lost, and other users can take advantage of the CANU changes.

1. Add an entry to the changelog on the first worksheet (`Summary`).

   The changelog should include:

   - The CANU command line used to validate the spreadsheet
   - The CANU version being used to validate the spreadsheet
   - An overview of changes made to the spreadsheet

1. Upload the SHCD to an official storage location after it has been validated.

   Either of the following options can be used:

   - `customer communication` (CAST ticket for customers)
   - SharePoint (internal systems and sometimes customer systems)
