# Configure Domain Name

A domain name is a name to identify the person, group, or organization that controls the devices within an area.
An example of a domain name could be `us.cray.com`.

## Configuration commands

```text
switch(config)# domain-name NAME
```

Show commands to validate functionality:

```text
switch# show domain-name
```

## Expected results

1. Administrators can configure the domain name
2. The output of all `show` commands is correct
