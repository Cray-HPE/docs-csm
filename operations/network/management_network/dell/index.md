# Dell Installation and Configuration Guide

### Dell Supplemental Guide to Mellanox Installations

![](../../../../img/network/management_network/intro.png)

Â© 2021 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

## Introduction

The intent for this documentation is to help install and manage Mellanox and Dell network devices in an HPE Cray EX supercomputer installation.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is with the CANU tool. Thus, this guide will not go to into a level of detail of how to configure each switch with the CLI in the topology. However, it will provide examples of how to configure and use features generated by CANU to provide administrators with an easy way to customize their installation.

This guide also includes the currently documented and supported network scenarios.

> **NOTE:** Not every configuration option is covered here, and for any configuration outside of the scope of this document, refer to the official Dell user manuals.

Dell documentation and software can be found from:

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.
