# Dell Installation and Configuration Guide

## Dell based networks

![](../../../../img/network/management_network/intro.png)

## Introduction

This documentation helps network administrators and support personnel install and manage Dell network devices in a CSM install.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is by using the CANU tool. Therefore this guide will not go into detail on how to configure each switch manually using the CLI. Instead, it will give helpful examples of how to configure/use features generated by CANU, in order to provide administrators easy ways to customize their installation.

Also included in this guide are the current documented and supported network scenarios.
**NOTE:** Not every configuration option is covered here; for any configuration outside of the scope of this document, refer to the official Dell user manual.

Dell documentation and software can be found from:
https://downloads.dell.com/

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.

**NOTE:** The display and command lines illustrated in this document are examples and might not exactly match any particular environment. The switch and accessory drawings in this document are for illustration only, and may not exactly match installed products.
