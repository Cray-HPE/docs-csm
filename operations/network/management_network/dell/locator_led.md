# Configure Locator LED

The Locator LED is an LED in the front of the chassis that can turn on or flash.
This is a useful feature when guiding someone to the switch during a "remote hands" situation,
such as asking an engineer to run a cable to the switch.

## Configuration Commands

Enable LED:

```text
location-led system 1 on
```

Disable LED:

```text
location-led system 1 off
```

## Expected Results

1. The Locator LED is in the off state
2. The Locator LED is now flashing
