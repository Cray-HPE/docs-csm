# Configure Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)

MSTP (802.1s) ensures that only one active path exists between any two nodes in a spanning-tree instance.
A spanning-tree instance comprises a unique set of VLANs.
MSTP instances significantly improve network resource utilization while maintaining a loop-free environment.

## Configuration Commands

Enable MSTP (default mode for spanning-tree):

```text
spanning-tree mode mst
name my-mstp-region
revision 0
```

Show commands to validate functionality:

```text
show spanning-tree mst
```

## Expected Results

1. Spanning-tree mode is configured
2. Spanning-tree is enabled, if loops are detected ports should go blocked state
3. Spanning-tree splits traffic domain between two DUTs
