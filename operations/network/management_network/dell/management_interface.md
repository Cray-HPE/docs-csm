# Configure Management Interface

The management interface can be used to gain remote management access to the switch.
The management interface is accessible using the `mgmt` VRF and is separate from the data plane interfaces, which are in the `default` VRF.

Alternatively, a loopback interface can be configured to be used as management interface.

## Configuration Commands

Configure the Management interface in CONFIGURATION mode:

```text
interface mgmt 1/1/1
```

Configure an IP address and mask on the Management interface in INTERFACE mode:

```text
ip address A.B.C.D/prefix-length
```

(Optional) Configure DHCP client operations in INTERFACE mode. By default, DHCP client is enabled on the Management interface:

`dhcp`

Enable the Management interface in INTERFACE mode:

```text
no shutdown
```

## Expected Results

1. Administrators can enable/disable the management interface
2. Administrators can assign an IP address to the management interface
3. Administrators can configure a loopback interface to be use for switch management
