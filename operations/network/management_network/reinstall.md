# Reinstall

Reinstall the same CSM version.

***Before continuing with install***, make sure that CANU is running the most current version: 

  * [Install/Upgrade CANU](canu_install_update.md)

> **CAUTION:** All of these steps should be done using an out-of-band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime.

## Procedure

1. If the switches being reinstalled are already in the right CSM version, no configuration changes should be required.

2. Check the differences between generated configs and the configs on the system.

   Refer to [Validate switch configs](validate_switch_configs.md).

3. Run a suite of tests against the management network switches.

   Refer to [Network tests](network_tests.md).
