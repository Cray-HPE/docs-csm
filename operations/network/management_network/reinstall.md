Reinstalling the same CSM version.

:exclamation: All of these steps should be done using an out of band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime :exclamation: 

1. If the switches you are re-installing are already in the right CSM version no configuration changes should be required.
1. [Validate switch configs](validate_switch_configs.md) 
    - Checks differences between generated configs and the configs on the system.
1. [Network tests](network_tests.md)
    - Run a suite of tests against the management network switches.
