# Reinstall

Reinstall the same CSM version.

> **CAUTION:** All of these steps should be done using an out-of-band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime.

## Procedure

1. If the switches being reinstalled are already in the right CSM version, no configuration changes should be required.
2. [Validate switch configs](validate_switch_configs.md) 
    - Checks differences between generated configs and the configs on the system.
3. [Network tests](network_tests.md)
    - Run a suite of tests against the management network switches.
