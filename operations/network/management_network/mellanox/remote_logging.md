# Remote logging

"In its most simplistic terms, the syslog protocol provides a transport to allow a machine to send event notification messages across IP networks to event message collectors - also known as syslog servers." â€“rfc3164

Note: the default facility is 3(DAEMON)

Relevant Configuration

Configure logging

```
switch(config)# logging <syslog-ip-address> [trap {<log-level> | override class <class> priority <log-level>}]
```

Expected Results

* Step 1: You can configure remote logging
* Step 2: You can see the log files from the switch on the remote server
