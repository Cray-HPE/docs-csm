# Introduction to CANU

CANU (CSM Automatic Network Utility) will guide you through to install new Shasta network and make the installation to follow best practices and set you up with supported configuration.

Some of the tasks that CANU can perform are:
* Check if the management switches on a Shasta network meet the firmware version requirements
* Check the cabling status of the management switches on a Shasta network using LLDP.
* Use a CANU-generated configuration to compare an existing network configuration against the best practice configuration.

CANU reads switch version information from the `canu.yaml` file in the root directory.

CANU documentation can be found here https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu

If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see this procedure: [Update CANU From CSM Tarball](../update_canu_from_csm_tarball.md)
