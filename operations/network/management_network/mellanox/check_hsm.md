# Check HSM

Hardware State Manager has two important parts:

* SLS - Systems Layout Service: This is the "expected" state of the system (as populated by networks.yaml and other sources).
* SMD - State Manager Daemon:  This is the "discovered" or active state of the system during runtime.

SLS:

```
curl  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" https://api_gw_service.local/apis/sls/v1/hardware | jq | less
```

The output from SLS should look like this:

```
{
  "Parent": "x1000c7s1b0",
  "Xname": "x1000c7s1b0n0",
  "Type": "comptype_node",
  "Class": "Mountain",
  "TypeString": "Node",
  "ExtraProperties": {
    "Aliases": [
      "nid001228"
    ],
    "NID": 1228,
    "Role": "Compute"
  }
}
```

SMD:

```
curl -s -k -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" https://api_gw_service.local/apis/smd/hsm/v1/Inventory/EthernetInterfaces | jq | less
```

Your output from SMD should look like this:

```
{
  "ID": "0040a6838b0e",
  "Description": "",
  "MACAddress": "0040a6838b0e",
  "IPAddress": "10.100.1.147",
  "LastUpdate": "2020-07-24T23:44:24.578476Z",
  "ComponentID": "x1000c7s1b0n0",
  "Type": "Node"
},
```
