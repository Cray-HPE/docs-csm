# Typical CANU validation errors and how to fix them 


* Example 1:  
```

validate_shcd - CRITICAL: A port number must be specified. Please correct the SHCD for HMN:V36 with an empty value 
```

***SOLUTION***: 	Blank cell. Minimally the Source or Destination and Port needs to be specified. 

* Example 2:  
```

Tab PDU not found in ./HPE System Hela CCD.revA27.xlsx 

Available tabs: ['Config. Summary', 'HPE Cables', 'RiverRackLayout ', 'Arista', 'River Device Diagrams', 'HPE Devices', 'SCT pt_pt', 'yaml', 'Mountain-TDS-Management', 'MTN Rack Layout', '10G_25G_40G_100G', 'NMN', 'HMN', 'PDU '] 
```

***SOLUTION***: 	PDU has an extra space in the tab name. 

Example 3:  
```

validate_shcd - ERROR:  On tab PDU, header column Slot not found.
```

***SOLUTION***: Make sure the header descriptions include the name Slot.

Example 4:  
```
validate_shcd - CRITICAL:  

On tab PDU, the header is formatted incorrectly. 

Columns must exist in the following order, but may have other columns in between: 

[0, 1, 2, 'Slot', 'Port', 'Destination', 'Rack', 'Location', 'Port'] 
```
***SOLUTION***: Fix the header naming to match the expected output. 
Example 5:
```  
network_modeling.NetworkNode: No available ports found for slot bmc and speed 25 in node sw-leaf-002
validate_shcd - CRITICAL: None
Failed to connect sw-leaf-002 to sw-leaf-bmc-002 bi-directionally while working on sheet HMN, row 25.
validate_shcd - CRITICAL: None
```
***SOLUTION***: Remove the connections going from sw-leaf-002 > sw-leaf-bmc-002, at this time CSM does not utilize these ports.
