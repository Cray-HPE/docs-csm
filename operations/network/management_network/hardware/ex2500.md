# EX2500 Installation and Cabling

This document helps network administrators and support personnel connect EX2500 cabinets to the Cray EX management network.

## HPE Cray EX2500 Quick Summary

A single rack can accommodate up to 24 compute blade slots within 3 compute chassis.

One rack supports the following

* Up to 3 compute chassis
* Up to 3 power shelves with 4 rectifiers per shelf - 12 total 15kw rectifiers per rack. (Note: 1 rectifier per shelf is used for redundancy)
* 3 PDUs (1 per power shelf)
* 3 power input whips (3-phase)
* Maximum of 24 compute blades
* Maximum of 24 HPE Slingshot switch blades
* Up to 2 in-rack Coolant distribution units for a max of 141KVA cooling capacity

### How does EX2500 connect to Shasta management network

Typically EX2500 cabinet connects in Shasta management network to the CDU switches (sw-cdu-00x).

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      EX2500-->sw-cdu-001;
      EX2500-->sw-cdu-002;
      sw-cdu-001-->sw-spine-001;
      sw-cdu-002-->sw-spine-001;
      sw-cdu-001-->sw-spine-002;
      sw-cdu-002-->sw-spine-002;
      sw-leaf-bmc-->sw-spine-001;
      sw-leaf-bmc-->sw-spine-002;
```

However, in some smaller setups where CDU switches are not present such as "test and development", it is possible to connect the EX2500 cabinet to spine or leaf switch.

#### How to connect EX2500 if CDU switches are not present

To connect an EX2500 cabinet to a smaller system without CDU switches will require a custom switch configuration from the network administrator as this layout is currently not
supported by [`canu`](https://github.com/cray-hpe/canu), the CSM management network configuration generation tool.  
Please note that [custom switch configs](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu/blob/main/docs/network_configuration_and_upgrade/custom_config.md) should still be processed
through [`canu`](https://github.com/cray-hpe/canu) so that CANU does not overwrite them when generating switch configs.

***As an example:*** In a system without CDU switches, you can alternatively connect the EX2500 to spine or leaf switches.

#### How to Add a EX2500 Cabinet to the Shasta Management Network

To add an EX2500 cabinet in your system, you first need to create a "Mountain-Management" tab in the system SHCD and add the cabinet as a line item in that tab. The SHCD will be
used to generate system seed files, or update SLS, depending on when in the system lifecycle the EX2500 is being added.

##### The table below is an example of how the EX2500 entry in the SHCD should appear if CDU switches are present

##### Alternatively if CDU switches are ***not*** present and you connected EX2500 directly to spine

| Source         | Rack    | Location | Slot | Port | Destination    | Rack    | Location | Port |

| `cec0`         | `x8000` | `c0`     |      | 1    | `sw-spine-001` | `x8000` | `u37`    | 2    |
| `cmm0`         | `x8000` | `c0`     |      | 2    | `sw-spine-002` | `x8000` | `u38`    | 1    |
| `sw-spine-001` | `x8000` | `u37`    |      | 48   | `sw-spine-002` | `x8000` | `u38`    | 48   |
| `sw-spine-001` | `x8000` | `u37`    |      | 49   | `sw-spine-002` | `x8000` | `u38`    | 49   |
| `sw-spine-001` | `x8000` | `u37`    |      | 50   | `sw-spine-002` | `x8000` | `u38`    | 50   |
