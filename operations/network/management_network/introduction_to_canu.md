## Introduction to CANU

The CSM Automatic Network Utility (CANU) is used to install new Shasta networks following the best practices configuration, and it sets the administrator up with a supported configuration. 

CANU is also used to check if the management switches on a Shasta network meet the firmware version requirements, and it checks their cabling status using LLDP. Alternatively, you could use the CANU generated configuration to compare the existing network configuration against the best practice configuration.

CANU reads switch version information from the _canu.yaml_ file in the root directory.
