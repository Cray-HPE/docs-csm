# Manual Switch Configuration

Some switch configuration is not generated by CANU and needs to be manually applied.

#### Prerequisites 
- Custom switch config backed up. 
    - [Manual Switch Config](manual_switch_config.md)

#### SNMP configuration
SNMP is currently only used on sw-leaf-bmc switches, these credentials can be retrieved from Vault.  More info on SNMP creds can be found on the [Change SNMP Credentials on Leaf Switches](../../../operations/security_and_authentication/Change_SNMP_Credentials_on_Leaf_Switches.md) page.

Once these credentials are retrieved from vault you can fill in the `xxxxxx` fields below and paste the commands into the switch.

##### Aruba

```
sw-leaf-001# conf t
