# Manual Switch Configuration

Some of the switch configuration is not generated by CANU and needs to be manually applied.

### Prerequisites

The custom switch config is backed up. See [Manual Switch Config](manual_switch_config.md).

### SNMP Configuration

SNMP is currently only used on sw-leaf-bmc switches, these credentials can be retrieved from Vault. More information on SNMP credentials can be found in the [Change SNMP Credentials on Leaf Switches](../../../operations/security_and_authentication/Change_SNMP_Credentials_on_Leaf_Switches.md) procedure.

Once these credentials are retrieved from vault, fill in the `xxxxxx` fields below and paste the commands into the switch.

#### Aruba

```
sw-leaf-001# conf t
```

Example output:

```
snmp-server vrf default
snmpv3 user testuser auth md5 auth-pass plaintext xxxxxx priv des priv-pass plaintext xxxxxx
```

#### Dell

```
sw-leaf-001# conf t
```

Example output:

```

snmp-server user xxxxxx cray-reds-group 3 auth md5 xxxxxx priv des xxxxxx
snmp-server view cray-reds-view 1.3.6.1.2 included
```
