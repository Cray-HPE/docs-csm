# Validate switch configs

#### Prerequisites 
- SSH access to the switches or the running config file.
- Generated Switch configs.
    - [Generate Switch Config](generate_switch_configs.md)
- CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.
  - Run `canu --version` to see version.
  - If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, see this procedure: [Update CANU From CSM Tarball](update_canu_from_csm_tarball.md)

#### Compare CSM 1.2 switch configs with running configs 

Next compare the current running configuration with the generated configuration.  

For the comparison, since we have pulled the configuration to our working directory we can compare the files locally. You can also have CANU pull the configuration from the switch by defining using the `--ip`, `--username`, and `--password` arguments.

Example of CANU pulling configuration.  

```bash
ncn# canu validate switch config --ip 192.168.1.1 --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --generated ./generated/sw-spine-001.cfg 
```

Doing file comparisons on your local machine:  

* Comparing configuration file for single switch:  

```bash
ncn# canu validate switch config --running ./running/sw-spine-001.cfg --generated sw-spine-001.cfg  
```

Please enter the vendor (Aruba, Dell, Mellanox): Aruba  

* Comparing configuration files for full system:  

```bash
ncn# canu validate network config --csm 1.2 --running ./running/ --generated ./generated/ 
```
 

CANU-generated switch configurations will not include any ports or devices not defined in the model. These were previously discussed in the Validate the SHCD section but include edge uplinks (CAN/CMN) and custom configurations applied by the customer..  When looking at the generated configurations being applied against existing running configurations CANU will recommend removal of some critical configurations. It is vital that these devices and configurations be identified and protected. This can be accomplished in three ways: 

* Provide CANU validation of generated configurations against running configurations with an override or "blackout" configuration â€“ a yaml file which tells CANU to ignore customer-specific configurations. The process of creating this file was previously described in the This file will be custom to every site and must be distributed with the analysis and configuration file bundle to be used in the future. 

* Based on experienced networking knowledge, manually reorder the proposed upgrade configurations. This may require manual exclusion of required configurations which the CANU analysis says to remove. 

* Some devices may be used by multiple sites and may not currently be in the CANU architecture and configuration. If a device type is more universally used on several sites, then it should be added to the architectural and configuration definitions via the CANU code and Pull Request (PR) process. 

Note:  A roadmap item for CANU is the ability to "inject" customer configurations into CANU and provide solid, repeatable configuration customization. 

 
#### Analyze CSM 1.2 configuration upgrade 

 Configuration updates depending on the current version of network configuration may be as easy as adding few lines or be complete rip & replace operation which may lead you to choosing to wipe the existing configuration or just simply adding few lines in the configuration.  

Always before making configuration changes, analyze the changes shown in the above configuration diff section.

:exclamation: All of these steps should be done using an out of band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime :exclamation:  

#### Caveats and known issues
- Mellanox and Dell support is limited.
- Some configuration may need to be applied in a certain order.
  - Example: `Customer VRF` needs to be applied before adding interfaces/routes to the VRF.
- When applying certain configuration it may wipe out pre-existing configuration.
  - An example of this would be adding a VRF to a port.

Safe Commands
These commands should be safe to run while the system is running. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

interface 1/1/mgmt0 
  no shutdown 
interface 1/1/30 
  mtu 9198

Manual Commands 
These commands may cause disruption to the system and should be done only during a maintenance period. 
It is recommended to have an out-of-band connection while running these commands. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

interface 1/1/mgmt0 
  vrf attach keepalive 
  ip address 192.168.255.0/31

  lag 256 

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Commands NOT classified as Safe or Manual 
These commands include authentication as well as unique commands for the system. 
These should be looked over carefully before keeping/applying.
