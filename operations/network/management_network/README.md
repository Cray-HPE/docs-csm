# Management Network User Guide

This documentation helps network administrators and support personnel install install and manage
Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox network devices in a CSM install.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is by using the CANU tool. Therefore this
guide will not go into detail on how to configure each
switch manually using the CLI. Instead, it will give helpful examples of how to configure/use
features generated by CANU, in order to provide administrators
easy ways to customize their installation.

Also included in this guide are the current documented and supported network scenarios.

**`NOTE`** Not every configuration option is covered here; for any configuration outside of the
scope of this document, refer to the official
Aruba, Dell, or Mellanox user manuals.

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.

**`NOTE`** The display and command lines illustrated in this document are examples and might not
exactly match any particular environment. The switch and
accessory drawings in this document are for illustration only, and may not exactly match installed
products.

## Adding Switch Admin Password to Vault

If CSM has been installed and Vault is running, add the switch credentials into Vault. Certain
tests, including `goss-switch-bgp-neighbor-aruba-or-mellanox` use these credentials to test the
state of the switch. This step is not required to configure the management network. If Vault is
unavailable, this step can be temporarily skipped. Any automated tests that depend on the switch
credentials being in Vault will fail until they are added.

First, write the switch admin password to the `SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable if it is not already
set.

```bash
read -s SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Once the `SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable is set, run the following commands to add the switch admin
password to Vault.

```bash
VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r '.data["vault-root"]' |  base64 -d)
alias vault='kubectl -n vault exec -i cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env VAULT_TOKEN="$VAULT_PASSWD" VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_FORMAT=json vault'
vault kv put secret/net-creds/switch_admin admin=$SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Note: The use of `read -s` is a convention used throughout this documentation which allows for the
user input of secrets without echoing them to the terminal or saving them in history.

## Switch configuration states

To check the current state of the switches, see [Upgrade](upgrade.md).

* `1.0 Config`: Non-generated switch configurations
* `1.2 Preconfig`: CANU-generated configurations for CSM 1.0
* `1.2 Config`: CANU-generated configurations for CSM 1.2

network.

* [Enhancements](#enhancements)
* [Fixes](#fixes)
* [Issues and workarounds](#issues-and-workarounds)

### Enhancements

Software enhancements are listed in reverse-chronological order, with the newest on the top of the
list.

Unless otherwise noted, each network version listed includes all enhancements added in earlier
versions.

#### Spanning-tree

In the Shasta management network version 1.2, Spanning-tree configuration is changing from RPVST
(RSTP) to MSTP, in order to allow for better vendor interoperability and simplified Spanning-tree
configuration. The new default configuration is as follows:

* Spanning-tree BPDU guard is removed from NCN LAG ports.
* Spanning-tree BPDU filter is removed.
* Spanning-tree admin-edge port settings are retained for allowing quicker PXE boot.
* Spanning-tree instance is tied to default (no longer multiple instances or per VLAN).
* Spanning-tree MSTP configuration name and revision in all configurations generated by CANU are
  set.
* Add peering from MetalLB to customer edge router.

### Fixes

### Issues and workarounds

The Symptom statement describes what a user might experience if this is seen on the network. The
Scenario statement provides additional environment details and trigger summaries. When available,

### Security Bulletin subscription service

To initiate a subscription to receive future HPE Security Bulletin alerts via email,
see the [`HPE Support Center`](https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/?language=en_US).

A Security Bulletin is the published notification of security vulnerabilities and is the only
communication
vehicle for security vulnerabilities.

* Fixes for security vulnerabilities are not documented in manuals, release notes, or other forms of
  product
  documentation.
* A Security Bulletin is released when all vulnerable products still in support life have publicly
  available
  images that contain the fix for the security vulnerability.
