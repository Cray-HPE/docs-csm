# Management Network User Guide

This documentation helps network administrators and support personnel install install and manage
Aruba, Dell, and Mellanox network devices in a CSM install.

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is by using the CANU tool. Therefore this
guide will not go into detail on how to configure each
switch manually using the CLI. Instead, it will give helpful examples of how to configure/use
features generated by CANU, in order to provide administrators
easy ways to customize their installation.

Also included in this guide are the current documented and supported network scenarios.

**`NOTE`** Not every configuration option is covered here; for any configuration outside of the
scope of this document, refer to the official
Aruba, Dell, or Mellanox user manuals.

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.

**`NOTE`** The display and command lines illustrated in this document are examples and might not
exactly match any particular environment. The switch and
accessory drawings in this document are for illustration only, and may not exactly match installed
products.

## Adding switch admin password to Vault

If CSM has been installed and Vault is running, add the switch credentials into Vault. Certain
tests, including `goss-switch-bgp-neighbor-aruba-or-mellanox` use these credentials to test the
state of the switch. This step is not required to configure the management network. If Vault is
unavailable, this step can be temporarily skipped. Any automated tests that depend on the switch
credentials being in Vault will fail until they are added.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Write the switch admin password to the `SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable if it is not already set.

    > The use of `read -s` is a convention used throughout this documentation which allows for the
    > user input of secrets without echoing them to the terminal or saving them in history.

    ```bash
    read -s SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Run the following commands to add the password to Vault.

    ```bash
    VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r '.data["vault-root"]' |  base64 -d)
    alias vault='kubectl -n vault exec -i cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env VAULT_TOKEN="$VAULT_PASSWD" VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_FORMAT=json vault'
    vault kv put secret/net-creds/switch_admin admin=$SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ```

* Fixes for security vulnerabilities are not documented in manuals, release notes, or other forms of product documentation.
* A Security Bulletin is released when all vulnerable products still in support life have publicly available
  images that contain the fix for the security vulnerability.
