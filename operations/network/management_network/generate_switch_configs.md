# Generate Switch Configurations

Generating configuration files can be done for singular switch or for the full system.

For example, if there is a suspected configuration issue on single switch, a configuration file can be generated for just that switch to make it easier to debug problems.

## Prerequisites

* CANU installed with version 1.1.11 or greater.
  * Run `canu --version` to see version.
  * If doing a CSM install or upgrade, a CANU RPM is located in the release tarball. For more information, refer to the [Update CANU From CSM Tarball](canu/update_canu_from_csm_tarball.md) procedure.
* Alternatively: Upgrade or install latest version of CANU [Install/Upgrade CANU](canu_install_update.md)
  * Run `canu --version` to see version
  * CANU installed with version 1.6.13 or greater.
* Validated SHCD.
  * See [Validate SHCD](validate_shcd.md).
* JSON output from validated SHCD.
  * See [Validate SHCD](validate_shcd.md).
* System Layout Service (SLS) input file.
  * If generating CSM 1.2 configurations, the SLS file will need to be updated prior to generating configurations.
  * See [Collect Data](collect_data.md).

## Generate Configuration Files

Ensure that the correct architecture (`-a` parameter) is selected for the setup in use.

The following are the different architectures that can be specified:

* `Tds` – Aruba-based Test and Development System. These are small systems characterized by Kubernetes NCNs cabled directly to the spine.
* `Full` – Aruba-based Leaf-Spine systems. These are usually customer production systems.
* `V1` – Any Dell and Mellanox based systems.

Generating a configuration file can be done for a single switch, or for the full system. Below are example commands for both scenarios:

**Important:** Modify the following items in your command:

* `--csm` : Which CSM version configuration do you want to use? For example, `1.2` or `1.0`
* `--a`   : What is the system architecture? (See above)
* `--ccj` : Match the `ccj.json` file to the one you created for your system.
* `--sls` : Match the `sls_file.json` to the one you created for your system.
* `--custom-config` : Pass in a switch configuration file that CANU will inject into the generated configuration. For more information, see the [CANU documentation](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/canu#generate-switch-configs-including-custom-configurations).

```console
    ncn# canu generate network config --csm 1.2 -a full --ccj system-ccj.json  --sls-file sls_file.json --custom-config system-custom-config.yaml --folder generated
    ```
```
