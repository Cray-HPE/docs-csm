# Prometheus SNMP Exporter

The Prometheus SNMP Exporter is deployed by the `cray-sysmgmt-health` chart to the `sysmgmt-health` namespace as part of the Cray System Management \(CSM\) release.

## Adding SNMP credentials to the system

Both the Prometheus SNMP Exporter and REDS hardware discovery use SNMP credentials stored in Vault. These credentials are read from
Vault and pushed into `customizations.yaml` as a [sealed secret](../../security_and_authentication/Manage_Sealed_Secrets.md). For
the SNMP Exporter and REDS hardware discovery to work, three things need to have been done by an administrator:

  1. The SNMP credentials need to have been pushed into the correct path in Vault.
      * [Updating the SNMP credentials for existing switches](../../security_and_authentication/Change_Air-Cooled_Node_BMC_Credentials.md)
      * [Updating the SNMP credentials for switches added in the future](../../security_and_authentication/Update_Default_Air-Cooled_BMC_and_Leaf_BMC_Switch_SNMP_Credentials.md)
  1. The SNMP credentials need to have been encrypted as sealed secrets and written to `customizations.yaml` (this is covered in the documentation linked in the previous bullet).
  1. The SNMP credentials need to be added to the running configuration on every management network switch.
      * Information about [managing Dell switches](dell/README.md) including [SNMPv2 community](dell/snmp-community.md) and
        [SNMPv3 user](dell/snmpv3_users.md) settings
      * Information about [managing Mellanox switches](mellanox/README.md) including [SNMPv2 community](mellanox/snmp_community.md) and
        [SNMPv3](mellanox/snmpv3_users.md) settings
      * Information about [managing Aruba switches](aruba/README.md) including [SNMPv2 community](aruba/snmp-community.md) and
        [SNMPv3](aruba/snmpv3_users.md) settings

Note: While the [Cray Automated Networking Utility (CANU)](canu/README.md) will typically not overwrite SNMP settings that are
manually applied to the management switches, there are certain cases where SNMP configuration can be over-written or lost (such
as when resetting and reconfiguring a switch from factory defaults). To persist the SNMP settings, see
[CANU Custom Configuration](canu/custom_config.md). CANU custom configuration files are used to persist site management network
configurations that are intended to take precedence over configurations generated by CANU.

If the Prometheus SNMP Exporter or REDS hardware discovery emit errors related to SNMP authentication, then an administrator should:

* Validate that the correct SNMP credential key/value pairs exist in Vault (see information above).
* [Validate that the SNMP credential sealed secrets in `customizations.yaml` match Vault](../../security_and_authentication/Manage_Sealed_Secrets.md#fix-an-incorrect-value-in-a-sealed-secret)
  and the credentials stored on the management switches.
* Validate that the SNMP credentials configured on the management switches match the credentials stored in Vault (see information above).

## Configuration

In order to provide data to the Grafana SNMP dashboards, the SNMP Exporter must be configured with a list of management network switches to scrape metrics from.

> **`NOTE`** All variables used within this page depend on the `/etc/environment` setup done in [Pre-installation](../../../install/pre-installation.md).

1. (`pit#`) Obtain the list of switches to use as targets using CSM Automatic Network Utility (CANU).

    ```bash
    canu init --sls-file ${PITDATA}/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/sls_input_file.json --out -
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    10.252.0.2
    10.252.0.3
    10.252.0.4
    10.252.0.5
    4 IP addresses saved to <stdout>
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Update `customizations.yaml` with the list of switches.

    ```bash
    yq write -s - -i ${PITDATA}/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml <<EOF
    - command: update
      path: spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-snmp-exporter
      value:
              serviceMonitor:
                enabled: true
                params:
                - name: snmp1
                  target: 10.252.0.2
                - name: snmp2
                  target: 10.252.0.3
                - name: snmp3
                  target: 10.252.0.4
    EOF
    ```

1. (`pit#`) Review the SNMP Exporter configuration.

    ```bash
    yq r ${PITDATA}/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-snmp-exporter
    ```

    The expected output looks similar to:

    ```yaml
    serviceMonitor:
      enabled: true
      params:
      - name: snmp1
        target: 10.252.0.2
      - name: snmp2
        target: 10.252.0.3
      - name: snmp3
        target: 10.252.0.4
    ```

The most common configuration parameters are specified in the following table. They must be set in the `customizations.yaml` file
under the `spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-snmp-exporter` service definition.

| Customization            | Default      | Description                                                                         |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `serviceMonitor.enabled` | `true`       | Enables `serviceMonitor` for SNMP Exporter \(default chart value is `true`\)        |
| `params.enabled`         | `true`       | Sets the SNMP Exporter `params` change to `true` \(default chart value is `false`\) |
| `params.conf.module`     | `if_mib`     | SNMP Exporter to select which module \(default chart value is `if_mib`\)            |
| `params.conf.target`     | `10.252.0.2` | Add list of switch targets to SNMP Exporter to monitor                              |

For a complete set of available parameters, consult the `values.yaml` file for the `cray-sysmgmt-health` chart.
