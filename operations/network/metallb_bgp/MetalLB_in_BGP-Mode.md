# MetalLB in BGP-Mode

MetalLB is a component in Kubernetes that manages access to `LoadBalancer` services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. There are `LoadBalancer` services on the Node Management Network \(NMN\),
Hardware Management Network \(HMN\), and Customer Access Network \(CAN\).

MetalLB can run in either `Layer2-mode` or `BGP-mode` for each address pool it manages. `BGP-mode` is used for the NMN, HMN, and CAN. This enables true load balancing \(`Layer2-mode` does failover, not
load balancing\) and allows for a more robust layer 3 configuration for these networks.

In `BGP-mode`, the MetalLB speakers will peer with the BGP router on the spine switches and advertise the service `LoadBalancer` IP addresses. The BGP routers will accept those advertised prefixes and
add them to the route table. The spines are configured with Equal-Cost Multi-Path \(ECMP\), meaning that each of these BGP route prefixes will load balance to any of the workers that has advertised
the prefix. This process allows clients outside the cluster with access to the NMN, HMN, or CAN to be able to route to these Kubernetes services.

BGP peering is only between the MetalLB speakers and the spine switches. It does not do any peering beyond that.

The routes in the BGP route table will only be the IP addresses of the Kubernetes `LoadBalancer` services. This is the fifth column displayed in the output of the following command:

```bash
ncn-mw# kubectl get service -A | grep LoadBalancer
```

For example:

MetalLB does not manage access to any of the NCNs, UANs, or compute nodes.
