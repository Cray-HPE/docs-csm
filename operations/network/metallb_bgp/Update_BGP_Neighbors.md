# Update BGP Neighbors

This page will detail the manual procedure to configure and verify BGP neighbors on the management switches.

You will not have BGP peers until CSM `install.sh` has run. This is where MetalLB is deployed.

* How do I check the status of the BGP neighbors?
    * Log into the spine switches and run `show bgp ipv4 unicast summary` for Aruba/HPE switches and `show ip bgp summary` for Mellanox.
* Are my Neighbors stuck in IDLE?
    * Running `clear ip bgp all` on the Mellanox and `clear bgp *` on the Arubas will restart the BGP process. This process may need to be done when a system is reinstalled or when a worker node is rebuilt.
    * If you cannot get the neighbors out of IDLE, make sure that passive neighbors are configured. This is in the automated scripts and shown in the example below. Passive neighbors should only be configured on NCN neighbors.
* The BGP neighbors will be the worker NCN IP addresses on the NMN (node management network) (VLAN002). If your system is using HPE/Aruba, one of the neighbors will be the other spine switch.

## Generate MetalLB configmap
* Depending on the network architecture of your system you may need to peer with switches other than the spines. CSI has a BGP peers argument that accepts 'aggregation' as an option, if no option is defined it will default to the spines as being the MetalLB peers.

CSI CLI arguments with `--bgp-peers aggregation`
```bash
linux# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme
linux# csi config init --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user root --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass $IPMI_PASSWORD --ntp-pools cfntp-4-1.us.cray.com,cfntp-4-2.us.cray.com --can-external-dns 10.103.8.113 --can-gateway 10.103.8.1 --site-ip 172.30.56.2/24 --site-gw 172.30.48.1 --site-dns 172.30.84.40 --site-nic em1 --system-name odin --bgp-peers aggregation
```

## Automated Process
For Mellanox there is a script `mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py` and for Aruba there is CANU (Cray Automated Network Utility).
In order for these scripts to work the following commands will need to be applied on the switches.

### Aruba

1. In order for the automated process to work, the following command will need to be run on the switches:

    ```
    sw-spine-001(config)# https-server rest access-mode read-write
    ```

2. Run CANU.

    CANU requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of Switch 2, and the path to the directory containing the file `sls_input_file.json`.

    The IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches. Make sure the `$SLS_PATH` variable is set to the correct directory.

    ```bash
    pit# SYSTEM_NAME=eniac
    pit# SLS_PATH="/var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/"
    pit# canu -s 1.5 config bgp --ips 10.252.0.2,10.252.0.3 --csi-folder "${SLS_PATH}"
    ```

### Mellanox

1. In order for the automated process to work, the following commands will need to be run on the switches:

    ```
    sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] > enable
    sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # configure terminal
    sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # json-gw enable
    ```

2. Run the BGP helper script.

    The BGP helper script requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of Switch 2, and the path to CSI-generated network files.

    * The IP addresses used should be Node Management Network IP addresses (NMN). These IP addresses will be used for the BGP Router-ID.
    * The path to the CSI-generated network files must include `CAN.yaml`, `HMN.yaml`, `HMNLB.yaml`, `NMNLB.yaml`, and `NMN.yaml`. The path must include the `$SYSTEM_NAME.`

    The IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches. Make sure the `$CSI_PATH` variable is set to the correct directory.

    ```bash
    pit# SYSTEM_NAME=eniac
    pit# CSI_PATH="/var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/networks/"
    pit# /usr/local/bin/mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py 10.252.0.2 10.252.0.3 "${CSI_PATH}"
    ```

   `*WARNING*` The mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py script assumes that the prefix length of the CAN is `/24`. If that value is incorrect for the system being installed then update the script with the correct prefix length by editing the following line.

    ```python
    cmd_prefix_list_can = "ip prefix-list pl-can seq 30 permit {} /24 ge 24".format()
    ```

### Verification

After following the previous steps, you will need to verify the configuration and verify the BGP peers are `ESTABLISHED`. If it is early in the install process and the CSM services have not been deployed yet, there will not be speakers to peer with, so the peering sessions may not be `ESTABLISHED` yet. This is expected and not a problem.

## Manual Process

On the Aruba switches, the output of the `show bgp ipv4 unicast summary` command should look like the following if the MetalLB speaker pods are running. If it is early in the install process and the CSM services have not been deployed yet, you may see the neighbors in `Idle`, `Active`, or `Connect` state. This is expected and not a problem.
```
sw-spine-001# show bgp ipv4 unicast summary
VRF : default

 10.252.2.8      65533       54730   62906   00m:02w:04d  Established   Up

 10.252.2.18     65533       54732   62911   00m:02w:04d  Established   Up
```
On the Mellanox switches, first you must run the switch commands listed in the Automated section above. The output of the `show ip bgp summary` command should look like the following if the MetalLB speaker pods are running. If it is early in the install process and the CSM services have not been deployed yet, you may see the neighbors in `IDLE`, `ACTIVE`, or `CONNECT` state. This is expected and not a problem.

```

```
* If the BGP neighbors are not in the `ESTABLISHED` state make sure the IP addresses are correct for the route-map and BGP configuration and the MetalLB speaker pods are running on all of the workers.
* If IP addresses are incorrect you will have to update the configuration to match the IP addresses, the configuration below will need to be edited.
* You can get the NCN IP addresses from the CSI-generated files (`NMN.yaml`, `CAN.yaml`, `HMN.yaml`), these IP addresses are also located in `/etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf` on the PIT node.
    ```bash
    pit# grep w00 /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | grep nmn
    host-record=ncn-w003,ncn-w003.nmn,10.252.1.13
    host-record=ncn-w002,ncn-w002.nmn,10.252.1.14
    host-record=ncn-w001,ncn-w001.nmn,10.252.1.15
    ```
* The route-map configuration will require you to get the HMN, and CAN IP addresses as well. Note the `Bond0 Mac0/Mac1` entry is for the NMN.
    ```bash
    pit# grep ncn-w /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | egrep "Bond0|HMN|CAN" | grep -v mgmt
    dhcp-host=50:6b:4b:08:d0:4a,10.252.1.13,ncn-w003,20m # Bond0 Mac0/Mac1
    dhcp-host=50:6b:4b:08:d0:4a,10.254.1.20,ncn-w003,20m # HMN
    dhcp-host=50:6b:4b:08:d0:4a,10.102.4.12,ncn-w003,20m # CAN
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:0f:39:4a,10.252.1.14,ncn-w002,20m # Bond0 Mac0/Mac1
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:0f:39:4a,10.254.1.22,ncn-w002,20m # HMN
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:0f:39:4a,10.102.4.13,ncn-w002,20m # CAN
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:bb:a9:94,10.252.1.15,ncn-w001,20m # Bond0 Mac0/Mac1
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:bb:a9:94,10.254.1.24,ncn-w001,20m # HMN
    dhcp-host=98:03:9b:bb:a9:94,10.102.4.14,ncn-w001,20m # CAN
    ```
* The Aruba configuration will require you to set the other peering switch as a BGP neighbor, the Mellanox configuration does not require this.
* You will need to delete the previous route-map, and BGP configuration on both switches.

### Aruba delete commands
```
sw-spine-001# configure terminal

sw-spine-001(config)# no router bgp 65533
This will delete all BGP configurations on this device.

```

* Once the IP addresses are updated for the route-maps and BGP neighbors you may need to restart the BGP process on the switches, you do this by running `clear ip bgp all` on the Mellanox and `clear bgp *` on the Arubas. (This may need to be done multiple times for all the peers to come up)
* When worker nodes are reinstalled, the BGP process will need to be restarted.
* If the BGP peers are still not coming up you should check the metallb.yaml config file for errors. The MetalLB config file should point to the NMN IP addresses of the switches configured.

### metallb.yaml configuration example

The peer-address should be the IP address of the switch that you are doing BGP peering with.
