# Apply switch configs

:exclamation: All of these steps should be done using an out of band connection. This process is disruptive and will require downtime :exclamation:  

If the switch is wiped you should be able to copy and paste the generated switch configs into the terminal.

Be sure to type `auto-confirm` before pasting in the configuration.
This will automatically accept prompts.

`switch(config)# auto-confirm`

Once this is complete for all the switches, you should validate that the switch configs match what is generated.  [validate switch configs](validate_switch_configs.md)
