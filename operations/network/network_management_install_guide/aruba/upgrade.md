# Performing VSX upgrade on Aruba switches

This command lets you update the switch software with minimal to no downtime. 

This command gives you the option to save the running configuration on the primary and secondary VSX switches. After the command saves the running configuration, it downloads new software from the TFTP server and verifies the download. After a successful verification, the command installs the software to the alternative image of both the VSX primary and secondary switches. 

The command displays the status of the VSX primary and secondary switches during the upgrade. The command also refreshes the progress bar as the image update progresses. Do not interrupt the VSX primary CLI session until the software updates completes; however, software update process can be stopped. 

If you stop the upgrade when the secondary switch has already installed the image in its flash memory or the secondary switch has started the reboot the process, it comes up with the new software.
 
The primary switch continues to have with older software. You can stop the software update process by pressing ctrl+c.
