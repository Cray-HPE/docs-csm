## Introduction

The intent for the this documentation is to help install and manage Aruba CX network devices in a Cray supercomputer installation. 

The HPE Cray recommended way of configuring the network is via the Canu tool, hence this guide will not go to level of detail of how to configure each switch via CLI in the topology, rather give you helpful examples of how to configure/use features generated by Canu to provide administrators easy way to customize their installation. 

Also included in this guide are our current documented and supported network scenarios.
Please do note that not every configuration option is covered here and for any configuration outside of the scope of this document; You should refer to the official Aruba user manuals. 

Aruba documentation and software can be found from:

This document is intended for network administrators and support personnel.
