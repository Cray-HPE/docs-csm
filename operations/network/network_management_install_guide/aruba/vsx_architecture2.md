# What are the benefits of VSX?

**No downtime, even during upgrades.**

High availability (HA) refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for extended periods of time. For organizations today, this translates to 24x7 uptime, without disruption to network access or performance.

Planning for high availability of campus and data center switches involves complex tasks for addressing backup and failover processing. This includes copying and accessing the real-time networking state, including routing and forwarding tables. 

Aruba VSX takes a new and innovative approach to solving high availability challenges by combining the best aspects of existing HA technologies such as multi-chassis link aggregation (MC-LAG) and equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. This combination provides a distributed and redundant architecture that is highly available, with minimal to zero traffic loss, even during software upgrades.

Aruba VSX Benefits

* High availability design with live upgrades and no downtime
* Built for redundancy across campus and data center networks 
* Continuous config synchronization via AOS-CX
* Flexible active-active network designs at L2 and L3
* Operational simplicity for configuration and troubleshooting

Thanks to its design principles, VSX also supports live  upgrades, delivering on the promise of in-service software upgrades where no maintenance windows are required. Within an hour, core and aggregation switches in the campus and top of rack (ToR) switches in the data center can be successfully upgraded while continuously delivering high-performing network services, without compromise
