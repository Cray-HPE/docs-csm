### Introduction to CANU

CANU (CSM Automatic Network Utility) will guide you through to install new Shasta network and make the installation to follow best practices and set you up with supported configuration. 

You can also use CANU to check if Aruba switches on a Shasta network meet the firmware version requirements and check their cabling status using LLDP. Alternatively you could use the Canu generated configuration to. Compare against your existing network configuration against best practice configuration.

CANU reads switch version information from the _canu.yaml_ file in the root directory.
