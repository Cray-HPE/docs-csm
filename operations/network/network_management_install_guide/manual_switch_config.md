# Manual switch configuration

Some switch configuration is not generated by CANU and needs to be manually applied.

#### SNMP configuration
SNMP is currently only used on sw-leaf-bmc switches, these credentials can be retrieved from vault.  More info on SNMP creds can be found on the [Change SNMP Credentials on Leaf Switches](../../operations/security_and_authentication/Change_SMNP_Credentials_on_Leaf_Switches.md) page.

Once these credentials are retrieved from vault you can fill in the `xxxxxx` fields below and paste the commands into the switch.
