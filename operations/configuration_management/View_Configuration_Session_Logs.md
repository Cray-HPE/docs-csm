## View Configuration Session Logs

Logs for the individual steps of a session are available via the kubectl log command for each container of a Configuration Framework Service \(CFS\) session. Refer to [Configuration Sessions](Configuration_Sessions.md) for more info about these containers.

To find the name of the Kubernetes pod that is running the CFS session:

```bash
ncn# kubectl get pods --no-headers -o \
custom-columns=":metadata.name" -n services -l cfsession=example
cfs-f9d18751-e6d1-4326-bf76-434293a7b1c5-q8tsc
```

Store the returned pod name as the `CFS_POD_NAME` variable for future use:

```bash
ncn# export CFS_POD_NAME=cfs-f9d18751-e6d1-4326-bf76-434293a7b1c5-q8tsc
```

To view the logs of the various containers:

```bash
ncn# kubectl logs -n services ${CFS_POD_NAME} -c ${CONTAINER_NAME}
```

The `${CONTAINER_NAME}` value is one of the containers mentioned in [Configuration Sessions](Configuration_Sessions.md). Depending on the number of configuration layers in the session, some sessions will have more containers available. Use the -f option in the previous command to follow the logs if the session is still running.

To view the Ansible logs, determine which configuration layerâ€™s logs to view from the order of the configuration set in the session. For example, if it is the first layer, the `${CONTAINER_NAME}` will be `ansible-0`.

```bash
ncn# kubectl logs -n services ${CFS_POD_NAME} -c ansible-0
```

The `git-clone-#` and `ansible-#` containers may not start at 0 and may not be numbered sequentially if the session was created with the --configuration-limit option.
