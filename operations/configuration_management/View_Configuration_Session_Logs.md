# View Configuration Session Logs

Ansible logs are now recorded with ARA and are accessible through the ARA UI.
See [Ansible Log Collection](Ansible_Log_Collection.md) for more information.

Logs for the other steps of a session are available via the `kubectl log` command for each container of a Configuration Framework Service \(CFS\) session. Refer to
[Configuration Sessions](Configuration_Sessions.md) for more info about these containers.

These can be run on any master or worker NCN.

To find the name of the Kubernetes pod that is running the CFS session:

```bash
kubectl get pods --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name" -n services -l cfsession=example
```

Store the returned pod name as the `CFS_POD_NAME` variable for future use:

```bash
CFS_POD_NAME=cfs-f9d18751-e6d1-4326-bf76-434293a7b1c5-q8tsc
```

Alternatively, if the session is one of many recent sessions and the session name is not known, it is possible to list all CFS pods by start time and pick the desired pod based on status or start time:

```bash
kubectl -n services --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp get pods | grep cfs
```

Example output:

```text

```

To view the logs of the various containers:

```bash
kubectl logs -n services ${CFS_POD_NAME} -c ${CONTAINER_NAME}
```

The `${CONTAINER_NAME}` value is one of the containers mentioned in [Configuration Sessions](Configuration_Sessions.md). To view the Ansible logs, the `${CONTAINER_NAME}` will be `ansible`.

```bash
kubectl logs -n services ${CFS_POD_NAME} -c ansible
```

Use the `-f` option with the previous command to follow the logs if the session is still running.
