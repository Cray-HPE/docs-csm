# Exporting and Importing CFS Data

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Export](#export)
- [Import](#import)

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the `cray` command line interface (CLI) is authenticated and configured to talk to system management services.
  - See [Configure the Cray CLI](../configure_cray_cli.md).
- The latest CSM documentation RPM must be installed on the node where the procedure is being performed.
  - See [Check for latest documentation](../../update_product_stream/README.md#check-for-latest-documentation).

## Export

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Run the following script to create a backup of the current CFS components, configurations, options, and sessions.

   ```bash
   /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/system_recovery/export_cfs_data.sh
   ```

   Expected output resembles the following:

   ```text
   Exporting CFS components...
   Exporting CFS configurations...
   Exporting CFS options...
   Exporting CFS sessions...
   Creating compressed archive of exported data...
   SUCCESS: CFS data stored in file: /tmp/cfs-export-20230410170613-Tg0nap.tgz
   ```

1. Copy the archive file it outputs to a safe location.

## Import

An automated tool is provided to import data from the archive file created by the `export_cfs_data.sh` script.

### Import tool overview

This tool does the following things:

- The live system will have its CFS options modified to match those in the archive file, for any that differ.
- For all CFS configurations in the archive file, if a CFS configuration with the same name does not exist on the live
  system, then the CFS configuration will be created on the live system.
  - Note: No validation is performed of the layers of these configurations to ensure that their repository links and commit hashes
    exist on the system.
- For all CFS components in the archive file, their desired configurations will be updated onto the corresponding component on the live
  system if all of the following criteria are met:
  - The component exists in CFS on the live system.
  - The CFS component in the archive has a desired configuration set.
  - The CFS component on the live system does NOT have a desired configuration set.
  - The desired configuration for this component in the archive either already exists on the live system, or is going to be created
    as part of this import process.

The script takes a snapshot of the live system CFS data before it makes any changes, and after all changes have been made.
The output of the script lists all of the updates it is making, as well as any updates that it is not performing because of the
criteria listed above.

### Import tool procedure

1. Copy the file generated by the export script on the node where the import procedure is being performed.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Run the following script to import the data from the archive file.

   > Modify the following example command to specify the path to the output file from the automated export script.

   ```bash
   /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/system_recovery/import_cfs_data.sh /tmp/cfs-export-20230410170613-Tg0nap.tgz
   ```
