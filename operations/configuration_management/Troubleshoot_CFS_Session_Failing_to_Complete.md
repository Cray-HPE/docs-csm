# Troubleshoot CFS Session Failing to Complete

Troubleshoot issues where Configuration Framework Service \(CFS\) sessions/pods fail and Ansible hangs. These issues can be resolved
by modifying Ansible to produce less output.

## Prerequisites

A CFS session or pod is failing to complete, and the Ansible logs are not showing progress or completion.

The following is an example of the error causing Ansible to hang:

```

## Reduce Ansible output

The steps in this procedure are independent from each other and are used to troubleshoot different underlying problems that both present a similar symptom.

Any of the following steps can be taken to help reduce the output generated by Ansible:

* Reduce the verbosity when running Ansible commands.

  If the session was created with a higher value of `--ansible-verbosity` \(three or higher\), Ansible can generate a lot of output
  that can cause the pod to hang. Reducing the verbosity by one or more may resolve this issue.

* Update the Ansible configuration to produce less output.

  See [Enable Ansible Profiling](Enable_Ansible_Profiling.md) for an example of modifying the configuration.

* Adjust the use of flags used when running Ansible commands.

  The `display_ok_hosts` and `display_skipped_hosts` are examples of settings that can be disabled to reduce output.
  See the Ansible documentation for more information on what flags can be used.
