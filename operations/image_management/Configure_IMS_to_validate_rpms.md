## Configure IMS to validate RPMS

Configuring IMS to validate the GPG signatures of RPMs during IMS Build operations involves two steps.

1. Create and update IMS to use a new Kiwi-NG Image with the Signing Keys embedded.
   
   **NOTE:** The default IMS Kiwi-NG Image is already configured with the signing keys needed to
   validate HPE and SuSE RPMs and repositories. 
   
2. Update IMS Recipes to require GPG verification of RPMs/Repos.

### Create and Update IMS to Use a New Kiwi-NG Image with an Embedded Signing Key

1. Create a temporary directory to perform the actions necessary to configure IMS to validate 
   RPM signatures.
   
    ```bash
    ncn# mkdir ims-validate
    ncn# cd ims-validate/
    ```

1. Determine the container version for the IMS Kiwi-NG container.

   ```bash
   ncn# kubectl -n services get cm cray-configmap-ims-v2-image-create-kiwi-ng -o yaml | grep cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
     - image: cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7
   ```
   
   If successful, make note of the version of the listed container. In this case, the version is `0.4.7`.


1. Create a file containing the public portion of the Signing Key to be added to the IMS Kiwi-NG image.

    ```bash
    ncn# cat my-signing-key.asc
    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    ...
    -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    ```

1. Obtain a copy of the cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder `entrypoint.sh` script.

   ```bash
   ncn # podman run -it --entrypoint "" --rm cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7 cat /scripts/entrypoint.sh | tee entrypoint.sh
   ```
  
1. Modify the `entrypoint.sh` script to pass the signing key to the `kiwi-ng` command.  

    ```bash
    ncn# cat entrypoint.sh
    ...
    # Call kiwi to build the image recipe. Note that the command line --add-bootstrap-package
    # causes kiwi to install the cray-ca-cert rpm into the image root.
    kiwi-ng $DEBUG_FLAGS --logfile=$PARAMETER_FILE_KIWI_LOGFILE --type tbz system build --description $RECIPE_ROOT_PARENT \
    --target $IMAGE_ROOT_PARENT --add-bootstrap-package file:///mnt/ca-rpm/cray_ca_cert-1.0.1-1.x86_64.rpm \
    --signing-key /signing-keys/my-signing-key.asc   # <--- ADD SIGNING-KEY FILE
    ...
    ```

1. Create a `Dockerfile` to create a new `cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder` image.
   
    ```bash
    ncn# cat Dockerfile
    FROM registry.local/cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7
    
    RUN mkdir /signing-keys
    COPY my-signing-key.asc /signing-keys
    COPY entrypoint.sh /scripts/entrypoint.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/scripts/entrypoint.sh"]
    ```

    **NOTE:** Make sure that the version of the `cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder`
    image in the `FROM` line matches the version of the image above.
   
1. Verify that the following files are in the temporary directory.

    ```bash
    ncn# ls
    Dockerfile  entrypoint.sh  my-signing-key.asc
    ```

1. Using the `podman` command, build and tag a new `cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder` image. 

    ```bash
    ncn# podman build -t registry.local/cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7-validate .
    STEP 1: FROM registry.local/cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7
    STEP 2: RUN mkdir /signing-keys
    --> Using cache 5d64aadcffd3f9f8f112cca75b886cecfccbfe903d4b0d4176882f0e78ccd4d0
    --> 5d64aadcffd
    STEP 3: COPY my-signing-key.asc /signing-keys
    --> Using cache c10ffb877529bdbe855522af93827503f76d415e2e129d171a7fc927f896095a
    --> c10ffb87752
    STEP 4: COPY entrypoint.sh /scripts/entrypoint.sh
    --> Using cache 6e388b60f42b6cd26df65ec1798ad771bdb835267126f16aa86e90aec78b0f32
    --> 6e388b60f42
    STEP 5: ENTRYPOINT ["/scripts/entrypoint.sh"]
    --> Using cache 46c78827eb62c66c9f42aeba12333281b073dcc80212c4547c8cc806fe5519b3
    STEP 6: COMMIT registry.local/cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7-validate
    --> 46c78827eb6
    46c78827eb62c66c9f42aeba12333281b073dcc80212c4547c8cc806fe5519b3
    ```

1. Push the new image to the image registry.

    ```bash
    ncn# podman push registry.local/cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7-validate
    ```

1. Update the IMS `cray-configmap-ims-v2-image-create-kiwi-ng` configmap to use this new image.
   
    ```bash
    ncn# n edit cm cray-configmap-ims-v2-image-create-kiwi-ng
    ...
    - image: cray/cray-ims-kiwi-ng-opensuse-x86_64-builder:0.4.7-validate
    ...
    ```
   
   **NOTE:** It may take several minutes for this change to take effect. Restarting IMS is not necessary.
   
1. Cleanup and remove the temporary directory

    ```bash
    ncn# cd ..
    ncn# rm -rf ims-validate/
    ```

### Update IMS Recipes to Require GPG Verification of RPMs/Repos

1. List the IMS recipes and determine which recipes need to be updated.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cray ims recipes list --format json
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    [

      [...]

      {
        "created": "2021-06-29T21:50:38.319526+00:00",
        "id": "1aab3dbb-a654-4c84-b820-a293bd4ab2b4",
        "link": {
          "etag": "",
          "path": "s3://ims/recipes/1aab3dbb-a654-4c84-b820-a293bd4ab2b4/my_recipe.tgz",
          "type": "s3"
        },
        "linux_distribution": "sles15",
        "name": "cos-2.1.51-slingshot-1.2.1",
        "recipe_type": "kiwi-ng"
      },
    
    [...]

    ]
    ```

1. Download the recipe archive for any recipe that will be updated.

    ```bash
    ncn# cray artifacts get ims recipes/1aab3dbb-a654-4c84-b820-a293bd4ab2b4/recipe.tar.gz recipe.tar.gz
    ```

1. Uncompress the recipe archive into a temporary directory.

    ```bash
    ncn# mkdir recipe
    ncn# tar xvfz recipe.tar.gz -C recipe/
    ncn# cd recipe/
    ```

1. Modify the recipe's `config.xml` file and enable gpg validation on any repos that should be validated.
   To validate each packageâ€™s GPG signature, add `package_gpgcheck="true"`. To validate the repository signature, 
   add `repository_gpgcheck="true"`.
   
    ```bash
    <repository type="rpm-md" alias="..." priority="2" imageinclude="true" package_gpgcheck="true">
        ...
    </repository>
    <repository type="rpm-md" alias="..." priority="2" imageinclude="true" repository_gpgcheck="true">
        ...
    </repository>
    ```
   
1. Create a new recipe tar file.

    ```bash
    ncn# tar cvfz ../recipe-new.tgz .
    ```
   
1. Move to the parent directory.
   
   ```bash
   ncn# cd ..
   ```
   
1. Create a new IMS recipe record.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cray ims recipes create --name "My Recipe" \
    --recipe-type kiwi-ng --linux-distribution sles15
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    created = "2018-12-04T17:25:52.482514+00:00"
    id = "2233c82a-5081-4f67-bec4-4b59a60017a6" 
    linux_distribution = "sles15"
    name = "my_recipe.tgz"
    recipe_type = "kiwi-ng"
    ```

    If successful, create a variable for the `id` value in the returned data.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# export IMS_RECIPE_ID=2233c82a-5081-4f67-bec4-4b59a60017a6
    ```

1. Upload the customized recipe to S3.

    It is suggested as a best practice that the S3 object name start with `recipes/` and contain the IMS recipe ID to remove ambiguity.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cray artifacts create ims recipes/$IMS_RECIPE_ID/recipe.tgz recipe-new.tgz
    ```

1. Update the IMS recipe record with the S3 path to the recipe archive.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cray ims recipes update $IMS_RECIPE_ID \
    --link-type s3 \
    --link-path s3://ims/recipes/$IMS_RECIPE_ID/recipe.tgz
    
    id = "2233c82a-5081-4f67-bec4-4b59a60017a6"
    recipe_type = "kiwi-ng"
    linux_distribution = "sles15"
    name = "my_recipe.tgz"
    created = "2020-02-05T19:24:22.621448+00:00"
    
    [link]
    path = "s3://ims/recipes/2233c82a-5081-4f67-bec4-4b59a60017a6/my_recipe.tgz"
    etag = ""
    type = "s3"
    ```
   
1. Cleanup and remove the temporary directory.

    ```bash
    ncn# cd ..
    ncn# rm -rf recipe/
    ```
