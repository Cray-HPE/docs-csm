# Swap a Compute Blade with a Different System

Swap an HPE Cray EX liquid-cooled compute blade between two systems.

- The two systems in this example are:

  - Source system - Cray EX TDS cabinet `x9000` with a healthy EX425 blade (Windom dual-injection) in chassis 3, slot 0

  - Destination system - Cray EX cabinet `x1005` with a defective EX425 blade (Windom dual-injection) in chassis 3, slot 0

- Substitute the correct component names (xnames) or other parameters in the command examples that follow.

- All the nodes in the blade must be specified using a comma-separated list. For example, EX425 compute blades include two node cards, each with two logical nodes (4 nodes).

## Prerequisites

- The Slingshot fabric must be configured with the desired topology for both blades.

- The System Layout Service (SLS) must have the desired HSN configuration.

- The blade that is removed from the source system must be installed in the empty slot left by the blade removed from destination system, and vice-versa.

- Check the status of the high-speed network (HSN) and record link status before the procedure.

- Review the following command examples.

  (`ncn-mw#`) The commands can be used to capture the required values from the HSM `ethernetInterfaces` table and write the values to a file.
  The file then can be used to automate subsequent commands in this procedure, for example:

    ```bash
    mkdir blade_swap_scripts; cd blade_swap_scripts
    cat blade_query.sh
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    BLADE=$1
    OUTFILE=$2

    BLADE_DOT=$BLADE.

    cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --format json | \
        jq -c --arg BLADE "$BLADE_DOT" \
            'map(select(.ComponentID|test($BLADE))) | map(select(.Description == "Node Maintenance Network")) | .[] | {xname: .ComponentID, ID: .ID,MAC: .MACAddress, IP: .IPAddresses[0].IPAddress,Desc: .Description}' > $OUTFILE
    ```

    ```bash
    ./blade_query.sh x1000c0s1 x1000c0s1.json
    cat x1000c0s1.json
    ```

    Example output:

    ```json
    {"xname":"x9000c3s1b0n0","ID":"0040a6836339","MAC":"00:40:a6:83:63:39","IP":"10.100.0.10","Desc":"Node Maintenance Network"}
    {"xname":"x9000c3s1b0n1","ID":"0040a683633a","MAC":"00:40:a6:83:63:3a","IP":"10.100.0.98","Desc":"Node Maintenance Network"}
    {"xname":"x9000c3s1b1n0","ID":"0040a68362e2","MAC":"00:40:a6:83:62:e2","IP":"10.100.0.123","Desc":"Node Maintenance Network"}
    {"xname":"x9000c3s1b1n1","ID":"0040a68362e3","MAC":"00:40:a6:83:62:e3","IP":"10.100.0.122","Desc":"Node Maintenance Network"}
    ```

    (`ncn-mw#`) To delete an `ethernetInterfaces` entry using `curl`:

    ```bash
    for ID in $(cat x9000c3s1.json | jq -r '.ID'); do cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete $ID; done
    ```

    (`ncn-mw#`) To insert an `ethernetInterfaces` entry using `curl`:

    > This requires an API token. See [Retrieve an Authentication Token](../security_and_authentication/Retrieve_an_Authentication_Token.md) for more information.

    ```bash
    while read PAYLOAD ; do
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -L -X POST 'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/smd/hsm/v2/Inventory/EthernetInterfaces' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data-raw "$(echo $PAYLOAD | jq -c '{ComponentID: .xname,Description: .Desc,MACAddress: .MAC,IPAddresses: [{IPAddress: .IP}]}')"
        sleep 5
    done < x9000c3s1.json
    ```

- The blades must have the coolant drained and filled during the swap to minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems.

  - Review procedures in *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*
  - Review the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200*

## Prepare the source system blade for removal

1. Using the work load manager (WLM), drain running jobs from the affected nodes on the blade. Refer to the vendor documentation for the WLM for more information.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Use Boot Orchestration Services (BOS) to shut down the affected nodes in the source blade (in this example, `x9000c3s0`).

   Specify the appropriate component name (xname) and BOS template for the node type in the following command.

   ```bash
   BOS_TEMPLATE=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
   cray bos v1 session create --template-name $BOS_TEMPLATE --operation shutdown --limit x9000c3s0b0n0,x9000c3s0b0n1,x9000c3s0b1n0,x9000c3s0b1n1
   ```

### Source: Disable the Redfish endpoints for the nodes

(`ncn-mw#`) Temporarily disable the Redfish endpoints for each compute node `NodeBMC`.

```bash
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints update --enabled false x9000c3s0b0 --id x9000c3s0b0
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints update --enabled false x9000c3s0b1 --id x9000c3s0b1
```

### Source: Clear Redfish event subscriptions from BMCs on the blade

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Set the environment variable `SLOT` to the blade's location.

    ```bash
    SLOT="x9000c3s0"
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Clear the Redfish event subscriptions.

   ```bash
   for BMC in $(cray hsm inventory  redfishEndpoints list --type NodeBMC --format json | jq .RedfishEndpoints[].ID -r | grep ${SLOT}); do
       /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/delete_bmc_subscriptions.py $BMC
   done
   ```

   Each BMC on the blade will have output like the following:

   ```text
   Clearing subscriptions from NodeBMC x3000c0s9b0
   Retrieving BMC credentials from SCSD
   Retrieving Redfish Event subscriptions from the BMC: https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions
   Deleting event subscription: https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/1
   Successfully deleted https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/1
   ```

### Source: Clear the node controller settings

(`ncn-mw#`) Remove the system specific settings from each node controller on the blade.

> The two commands look similar, but note that the component names (xnames)
> in the URLs differ slightly, targeting each node controller on the blade.

```bash
curl -k -u root:PASSWORD -X POST -H \
         'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ResetType":"StatefulReset"}' \
         https://x9000c3s0b0/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/Actions/Manager.Reset
curl -k -u root:PASSWORD -X POST -H \
         'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ResetType":"StatefulReset"}' \
         https://x9000c3s0b1/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/Actions/Manager.Reset
```

Use `Ctrl`-`C` to return to the prompt if command does not return.

### Source: Power off the chassis slot

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Suspend the `hms-discovery` cronjob.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n services patch cronjobs hms-discovery -p '{"spec" : {"suspend" : true }}'
   ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Verify that the `hms-discovery` cronjob has stopped.

   That is, verify that `ACTIVE` = `0` and `SUSPEND` = `True`.

   ```bash
   kubectl get cronjobs -n services hms-discovery
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME             SCHEDULE        SUSPEND     ACTIVE   LAST   SCHEDULE  AGE
   hms-discovery    */3 * * * *     True         0       117s             15d
   ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Power off the chassis slot.

   This examples powers off slot 0, chassis 3, in cabinet 9000.

   ```bash
   cray capmc xname_off create --xnames x9000c3s0 --recursive true
   ```

### Source: Disable the chassis slot

(`ncn-mw#`) Disable the chassis slot.

Disabling the slot prevents `hms-discovery` from automatically powering on the slot. This example disables slot 0, chassis 3, in cabinet 9000.

```bash
cray hsm state components enabled update --enabled false x9000c3s0 --id x9000c3s0
```

### Source: Record MAC and IP addresses for nodes

**IMPORTANT:** Record the node management network (NMN) MAC and IP addresses for each node in the blade (labeled `Node Maintenance Network`). To prevent disruption in the
data virtualization service (DVS), these addresses must be maintained in the HSM when the blade is swapped and discovered.

The hardware management network MAC and IP addresses are assigned algorithmically and **must not be deleted** from the HSM.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Query HSM to determine the `ComponentID`, MAC addresses, and IP addresses for each node in the blade.

   The prerequisites show an example of how to gather HSM values and store them to a file.

   ```bash
   cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --component-id x9000c3s0b0n0 --format json
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "ID": "0040a6836339",
       "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
       "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:39",
       "LastUpdate": "2021-04-09T21:51:04.662063Z",
       "ComponentID": "x9000c3s0b0n0",
       "Type": "Node",
       "IPAddresses": [
         {
           "IPAddress": "10.100.0.10"
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

1. Record the following values for the blade:

   ```text
   "ComponentID": "x9000c3s0b0n0"
   "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:39"
   "IPAddress": "10.100.0.10"
   ```

1. Repeat the command to record the component IDs, MAC addresses, and IP addresses for the Node Maintenance Network for the other nodes in the blade.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete the NMN MAC and IP addresses of each node in the blade from the HSM.

   **Do not delete the MAC and IP addresses for the node BMC**.

   ```bash
   cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete 0040a6836339
   ```

1. Repeat the preceding command for each node in the blade.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete the Redfish endpoints for each node.

   ```bash
   cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints delete x9000c3s0b0
   cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints delete x9000c3s0b1
   ```

### Source: Remove the blade

1. Remove the blade from the source system.
   Review the *Remove a Compute Blade Using the Lift* procedure in *HPE Cray EX Hardware Replacement Procedures H-6173* for detailed instructions for replacing liquid-cooled blades ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).
1. Drain the coolant from the blade and fill with fresh coolant to minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems.
   Review *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*. If using the hand pump, review procedures in the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200* ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).
1. Install the blade from the source system in a storage rack or leave it on the cart.

## Prepare the blade in the destination system for removal

1. Use WLM to drain jobs from the affected nodes on the blade.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Use BOS to shut down the affected nodes in the destination blade (in this example, `x1005c3s0`).

    ```bash
    BOS_TEMPLATE=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
    cray bos v1 session create --template-name $BOS_TEMPLATE --operation shutdown \
            --limit x1005c3s0b0n0,x1005c3s0b0n1,x1005c3s0b1n0,x1005c3s0b1n1
    ```

### Destination: Disable the Redfish endpoints for the nodes

(`ncn-mw#`) When nodes are `Off`, temporarily disable endpoint discovery service (MEDS) for the compute nodes.

Disabling chassis slot prevents `hms-discovery` from attempting to power them back on.

```bash
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints update --enabled false x1005c3s0b0 --id x1005c3s0b0
cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints update --enabled false x1005c3s0b1 --id x1005c3s0b1
```

### Destination: Clear Redfish event subscriptions from BMCs on the blade

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Set the environment variable `SLOT` to the blade's location.

    ```bash
    SLOT="x9000c3s0"
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Clear the Redfish event subscriptions.

   ```bash
   export TOKEN=$(curl -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
           -d client_id=admin-client \
           -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
           https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')

   for BMC in $(cray hsm inventory  redfishEndpoints list --type NodeBMC --format json | jq .RedfishEndpoints[].ID -r | grep ${SLOT}); do
       /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/delete_bmc_subscriptions.py $BMC
   done
   ```

   Each BMC on the blade will have output like the following:

   ```text
   Clearing subscriptions from NodeBMC x3000c0s9b0
   Retrieving BMC credentials from SCSD
   Retrieving Redfish Event subscriptions from the BMC: https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions
   Deleting event subscription: https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/1
   Successfully deleted https://x3000c0s9b0/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/1
   ```

### Destination: Clear the node controller settings

(`ncn-mw#`) Remove system-specific settings from each node controller on the blade.

> The two commands look similar, but note that the component names (xnames)
> in the URLs differ slightly, targeting each node controller on the blade.

```bash
curl -k -u root:PASSWORD -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
        '{"ResetType": "StatefulReset"}' \
        https://x1005c3s0b0/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/Actions/Manager.Reset
curl -k -u root:PASSWORD -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
        '{"ResetType": "StatefulReset"}' \
        https://x1005c3s0b1/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/Actions/Manager.Reset
```

### Destination: Power off the chassis slot

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Suspend the `hms-discovery` cronjob.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services patch cronjobs hms-discovery -p '{"spec": {"suspend": true }}'
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Destination: Verify that the `hms-discovery` cronjob has stopped.

   That is, verify that `ACTIVE` = `0` and `SUSPEND` = `True`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get cronjobs -n services hms-discovery
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME             SCHEDULE        SUSPEND     ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE    AGE
    hms-discovery    */3 * * * *     True         0       128s             15d
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Destination: Power off the chassis slot.

   This example powers off slot 0 in chassis 3 of cabinet 1005.

    ```bash
    cray capmc xname_off create --xnames x1005c3s0 --recursive true
    ```

### Destination: Disable the chassis slot

(`ncn-mw#`) Disable the chassis slot.

This example disables slot 0, chassis 3, in cabinet 1005.

```bash
cray hsm state components enabled update --enabled false x1005c3s0 --id x1005c3s0
```

### Destination: Record the NIC MAC and IP addresses

**IMPORTANT:** Record the component ID, MAC addresses, and IP addresses for each node in the blade in the destination system. To prevent disruption in the data virtualization
service (DVS), these addresses must be maintained in the HSM when the replacement blade is swapped and discovered.

The hardware management network NIC MAC addresses for liquid-cooled blades are assigned algorithmically and **must not be deleted** from the HSM.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Query HSM to determine the component ID, MAC addresses, and IP addresses associated with nodes in the destination blade.

   The prerequisites show an example of how to gather HSM values and store them to a file.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list \
            --component-id XNAME --format json
    ```

    Example output:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "ID": "0040a6836399",
        "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
        "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:99",
        "LastUpdate": "2021-04-09T21:51:04.662063Z",
        "ComponentID": "x1005c3s0b0n0",
        "Type": "Node",
        "IPAddresses": [
          {
            "IPAddress": "10.100.0.123"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Record the following Node Maintenance Network values for each node in the blade.

    ```text
    "ComponentID": "x1005c3s0b0n0"
    "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:99"
    "IPAddress": "10.10.0.123"
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete the node NIC MAC and IP addresses from the HSM `ethernetInterfaces` table for each node.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete 0040a6836399
    ```

1. Repeat the preceding command for each node in the blade.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete the Redfish endpoints for each node.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints delete x1005c3s0b0
    cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints delete x1005c3s0b1
    ```

### Destination: Swap the blade hardware

1. Remove the blade from destination system install it in a storage cart.

1. Install the blade from the source system into the destination system.

### Bring up the blade in the destination system

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Obtain an authentication token to access the API gateway.

   In the example below, replace `myuser`, `mypass`, and `shasta` in the `curl` command with site-specific values. Note
   the value of `access_token`. Review [Retrieve an Authentication Token](../security_and_authentication/Retrieve_an_Authentication_Token.md) for more information. The example is a
   script to secure a token and set it to the variable `TOKEN`.

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(curl -s -d grant_type=password -d client_id=shasta -d \
            username=USERNAME -d password=PASSWORD \
            https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
    echo $TOKEN
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Stop Kea from automatically adding MAC address entries to the HSM `ethernetInterfaces` table.

    Kea automatically adds entries to the HSM `ethernetInterfaces` table when a DHCP lease is provided (about every 5 minutes). To prevent Kea from automatically adding these entries,
    perform the following steps:

    1. Create an `eth_interfaces` file that contains the interface IDs for the `Node Maintenance Network` entries for the destination system.

       When repeating this procedure for the source system, use the interface IDs for the source system.

       ```bash
       cat eth_interfaces
       ```

       Example output:

       ```text
       0040a6836339
       0040a683633a
       0040a68362e2
       0040a68362e3
       ```

    1. Run the following commands in succession to remove the interfaces.

       Deleting the `cray-dhcp-kea` pod prevents the interfaces from being re-created.

       ```bash
       kubectl delete -n services pod $(kubectl get pods -n services | grep cray-dhcp-kea- | awk '{ print $2 }')
       for ETH in $(cat eth_interfaces); do cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete $ETH --format json ; done
       ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Add the MAC address, IP address, and `Node Maintenance Network` description to the interfaces.

   The component ID and IP address must be the values recorded from the destination
   blade, and the MAC address must be the value recorded from the source blade.

    ```text
    "ComponentID": "x1005c3s0b0n0"
    "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:99"
    "IPAddress": "10.10.0.123"
    ```

    ```bash
    MAC=SOURCESYS_MAC_ADDRESS
    IP_ADDRESS=DESTSYS_IP_ADDRESS
    XNAME=DESTSYS_XNAME
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -L -X POST 'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/smd/hsm/v2/Inventory/EthernetInterfaces' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw "{
                \"Description\": \"Node Maintenance Network\",
                \"MACAddress\": \"$MAC\",
                \"IPAddresses\": [
                    {
                        \"IPAddress\": \"$IP_ADDRESS\"
                    }
                ],
                \"ComponentID\": \"$XNAME\"
            }"
    ```

    When repeating this procedure for the source system, the component ID and IP address must be the values recorded from the source system,
    and the MAC address must be the value recorded from the blade in the destination system.

    ```bash
    MAC=DESTSYS_MAC_ADDRESS
    IP_ADDRESS=SOURCESYS_IP_ADDRESS
    XNAME=SOURCESYS_XNAME
    ```

    To change or correct a `curl` command that has been entered, use a `PATCH` request. For example:

    ```bash
    curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -L -X PATCH \
            'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/smd/hsm/v2/Inventory/EthernetInterfaces/0040a68350a4' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data-raw '{"MACAddress":"xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx","IPAddresses":[{"IPAddress":"10.xxx.xxx.xxx"}],"ComponentID":"XNAME"}'
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Restart Kea.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pods -n services -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-dhcp-kea
    ```

1. Repeat the preceding step for each node in the blade.

### Enable and power on the chassis slot

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Enable the chassis slot.

    The example enables slot 0, chassis 3, in cabinet 1005.

    ```bash
    cray hsm state components enabled update --enabled true x1005c3s0 --id x1005c3s0
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Power on the chassis slot.

    The example powers on slot 0, chassis 3, in cabinet 1005.

    ```bash
    cray capmc xname_on create --xnames x1005c3s0 --recursive true
    ```

### Enable discovery

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Verify that the `hms-discovery` cronjob is not suspended in Kubernetes.

    That is, verify that `ACTIVE` = `1` and `SUSPEND` = `False`.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services patch cronjobs hms-discovery \
        -p '{"spec" : {"suspend" : false }}'
    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl get cronjobs.batch -n services hms-discovery
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME             SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST   SCHEDULE  AGE
    hms-discovery    */3 * * * *   False       1      41s              33d
    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -Ao wide | grep hms-discovery
    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services logs hms-discovery-1600117560-5w95d \
        hms-discovery | grep "Mountain discovery finished" | jq '.discoveredXnames'
    ```

    Example output:

    ```json
    [
      "x1005c3s0b0"
    ]
    ```

1. Wait for three minutes for the blade to power on and the node controllers (BMCs) to be discovered.

### Verify that discovery has completed

1. (`ncn-mw#`) To verify that the BMCs have been discovered by the HSM, run this command for each BMC in the blade.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints describe XNAME --format json
    ```

    Example output:

    ```json
    {
        "ID": "x1005c3s0b0",
        "Type": "NodeBMC",
        "Hostname": "x1005c3s0b0",
        "Domain": "",
        "FQDN": "x1005c3s0b0",
        "Enabled": true,
        "User": "root",
        "Password": "",
        "MACAddr": "02:03:E8:00:31:00",
        "RediscoverOnUpdate": true,
        "DiscoveryInfo": {
            "LastDiscoveryAttempt": "2021-06-10T18:01:59.920850Z",
            "LastDiscoveryStatus": "DiscoverOK",
            "RedfishVersion": "1.2.0"
        }
    }
    ```

    - When `LastDiscoveryStatus` displays as `DiscoverOK`, the node BMC has been successfully discovered.
    - If the last discovery state is `DiscoveryStarted`, then the BMC is currently being inventoried by HSM.
    - If the last discovery state is `HTTPsGetFailed` or `ChildVerificationFailed`, then an error has
      occurred during the discovery process.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Optional: Force rediscovery of the components in the chassis.

    This example shows cabinet 1005, chassis 3.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory discover create --xnames x1005c3b0
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Optional: Verify that discovery has completed.

    That is, verify that `LastDiscoveryStatus` = `DiscoverOK`.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints describe x1005c3 --format json
    ```

    Example output:

    ```json
    {
        "ID": "x1005c3",
        "Type": "ChassisBMC",
        "Hostname": "x1005c3",
        "Domain": "",
        "FQDN": "x1005c3",
        "Enabled": true,
        "User": "root",
        "Password": "",
        "MACAddr": "02:03:ED:03:00:00",
        "RediscoverOnUpdate": true,
        "DiscoveryInfo": {
            "LastDiscoveryAttempt": "2020-09-03T19:03:47.989621Z",
            "LastDiscoveryStatus": "DiscoverOK",
            "RedfishVersion": "1.2.0"
        }
    }
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Enable the nodes in the HSM database.

    ```bash
    cray hsm state components bulkEnabled update --enabled true \
        --component-ids x1005c3s0b0n0,x1005c3s0b0n1,x1005c3s0b1n0,x1005c3s0b1n1
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Verify that the nodes are enabled in the HSM.

    ```bash
    cray hsm state components query create \
        --component-ids x1005c3s0b0n0,x1005c3s0b0n1,x1005c3s0b1n0,x1005c3s0b1n1 --format toml
    ```

    Partial example output:

    ```toml
    [[Components]]
    ID = x1005c3s0b0n0
    Type = "Node"
    Enabled = true
    State = "Off"

    [[Components]]
    ID = x1005c3s0b1n1
    Type = "Node"
    Enabled = true
    State = "Off"
    ```

### Power on and boot the nodes

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Use boot orchestration to power on and boot the nodes.

    Specify the appropriate BOS template for the node type.

    ```bash
    BOS_TEMPLATE=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
    cray bos v1 session create --template-name $BOS_TEMPLATE \
            --operation reboot --limit x1005c3s0b0n0,x1005c3s0b0n1,x1005c3s0b1n0,x1005c3s0b1n1
    ```

### Check firmware

1. Verify that the correct firmware versions for node BIOS, node controller (nC), NIC mezzanine card (NMC), GPUs, and so on.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) If necessary, update the firmware.

    Review the [FAS Admin Procedures](../firmware/FAS_Admin_Procedures.md) and [Update Firmware with FAS](../firmware/Update_Firmware_with_FAS.md) procedure.

    ```bash
    cray fas actions create CUSTOM_DEVICE_PARAMETERS.json
    ```

### Check DVS

There should be a `cray-cps` pod (the broker), three `cray-cps-etcd` pods and their waiter, and at least one `cray-cps-cm-pm` pod. Usually there are two `cray-cps-cm-pm` pods:
one on `ncn-w002`, and one on `ncn-w003` or another worker node.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Verify that the `cray-cps` pods on worker nodes are `Running`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -Ao wide | grep cps
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    services   cray-cps-75cffc4b94-j9qzf    2/2  Running   0   42h 10.40.0.57  ncn-w001
    services   cray-cps-cm-pm-g6tjx         5/5  Running   21  41h 10.42.0.77  ncn-w003
    services   cray-cps-cm-pm-kss5k         5/5  Running   21  41h 10.39.0.80  ncn-w002
    services   cray-cps-etcd-knt45b8sjf     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.42.0.67  ncn-w003
    services   cray-cps-etcd-n76pmpbl5h     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.39.0.49  ncn-w002
    services   cray-cps-etcd-qwdn74rxmp     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.40.0.42  ncn-w001
    services   cray-cps-wait-for-etcd-jb95m 0/1  Completed
    ```

1. (`ncn-w#`) SSH to each worker node running CPS/DVS, and run `dmesg -T` to ensure that there are no recurring `"DVS: merge_one"` error messages as shown.

   The error messages indicate that DVS is detecting an IP address change for one of the client nodes.

    ```bash
    dmesg -T | grep "DVS: merge_one"
    ```

    ```text
    [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#351: New node map entry does not match the existing entry
    [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#353:   nid: 8 -> 8
    [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#355:   name: 'x3000c0s19b1n0' -> 'x3000c0s19b1n0'
    [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#357:   address: '10.252.0.26@tcp99' -> '10.252.0.33@tcp99'
    [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#358:   Ignoring.
    ```

1. Make sure the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) finished successfully. Review *HPE Cray EX DVS Administration Guide 1.4.1 `S-8004`*.

1. (`nid#`) SSH to the node and check each DVS mount.

    ```bash
    mount | grep dvs | head -1
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    /var/lib/cps-local/0dbb42538e05485de6f433a28c19e200 on /var/opt/cray/gpu/nvidia-squashfs-21.3 type dvs (ro,relatime,blksize=524288,statsfile=/sys/kernel/debug/dvs/mounts/1/stats,attrcache_timeout=14400,cache,nodatasync,noclosesync,retry,failover,userenv,noclusterfs,killprocess,noatomic,nodeferopens,no_distribute_create_ops,no_ro_cache,loadbalance,maxnodes=1,nnodes=6,nomagic,hash_on_nid,hash=modulo,nodefile=/sys/kernel/debug/dvs/mounts/1/nodenames,nodename=x3000c0s6b0n0:x3000c0s5b0n0:x3000c0s4b0n0:x3000c0s9b0n0:x3000c0s8b0n0:x3000c0s7b0n0)
    ```

    ```bash
    ls /var/opt/cray/gpu/nvidia-squashfs-21.3
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    rootfs
    ```

### Check the HSN for the affected nodes

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Determine the pod name for the Slingshot fabric manager pod and check the status of the fabric.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it -n services \
        $(kubectl get pods --all-namespaces |grep slingshot | awk '{print $2}') \
        -- fmn_status
    ```

### Check DNS

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check for duplicate IP address entries in the State Management Database (SMD).

    Duplicate entries will cause DNS operations to fail.

    ```bash
    ssh uan01
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname uan01: Temporary failure in name resolution
    ```

    ```bash
    ssh x3000c0s14b0n0
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname x3000c0s14b0n0: Temporary failure in name resolution
    ```

    ```bash
    ssh x1000c1s1b0n1
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname x1000c1s1b0n1: Temporary failure in name resolution
    ```

    The Kea configuration error will display a message similar to the message below. This message indicates a duplicate IP address (`10.100.0.105`) in the SMD:

    ```text
    Config reload failed
    [{'result': 1, 'text': "Config reload failed: configuration error using file '/usr/local/kea/cray-dhcp-kea-dhcp4.conf': 
    failed to add new host using the HW address '00:40:a6:83:50:a4 and DUID '(null)' to the IPv4 subnet id '0' for the address 10.100.0.105: There's already a reservation for this address"}]
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check for active DHCP leases.

    If there are no DHCP leases, then there is a configuration error.

    > This requires an API token. See [Retrieve an Authentication Token](../security_and_authentication/Retrieve_an_Authentication_Token.md) for more information.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{ "command": "lease4-get-all", "service": [ "dhcp4" ] }' https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/dhcp-kea | jq
    ```

    Example output in the case of a configuration error:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "arguments": {
          "leases": []
        },
        "result": 3,
        "text": "0 IPv4 lease(s) found."
      }
    ]
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Delete any duplicate entries.

    If there are duplicate entries in the SMD as a result of the swap procedure (`10.100.0.105` in this example), then delete the duplicate entry.

    1. Show the `EthernetInterfaces` for the duplicate IP address:

       ```bash
       cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --ip-address 10.100.0.105 --format json | jq
       ```

       Example output:

       ```json
       [
         {
           "ID": "0040a68350a4",
           "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
           "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:50:a4",
           "IPAddress": "10.100.0.105",
           "LastUpdate": "2021-08-24T20:24:23.214023Z",
           "ComponentID": "x1000c7s7b0n1",
           "Type": "Node"
         },
         {
           "ID": "0040a683639a",
           "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
           "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:9a",
           "IPAddress": "10.100.0.105",
           "LastUpdate": "2021-08-27T19:15:53.697459Z",
           "ComponentID": "x1000c7s7b0n1",
           "Type": "Node"
         }
       ]
       ```

    1. Delete the older entry.

       ```bash
       cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete 0040a68350a4
       ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check DNS.

    ```bash
    nslookup 10.252.1.29
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01.
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01.local.
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = x3000c0s14b0n0.
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = x3000c0s14b0n0.local.
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01-nmn.
    1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01-nmn.local.
    ```

    ```bash
    nslookup uan01
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    Server:     10.92.100.225
    Address:    10.92.100.225#53

    Name:   uan01
    Address: 10.252.1.29
    ```

    ```bash
    nslookup x3000c0s14b0n0
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    Server:     10.92.100.225
    Address:    10.92.100.225#53

    Name:   x3000c0s14b0n0
    Address: 10.252.1.29
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check SSH.

    ```bash
    ssh x3000c0s14b0n0
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    The authenticity of host 'x3000c0s14b0n0 (10.252.1.29)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:wttHXF5CaJcQGPTIq4zWp0whx3JTwT/tpx1dJNyyXkA.

### Bring up the blade in the source system

1. To minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems, drain the coolant from the blade removed from destination system and fill with fresh coolant.

    Review the *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*. If using the hand pump, review procedures in the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200* ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).

1. Install the blade from the destination system into source system.

    Review the *Remove a Compute Blade Using the Lift* procedure in *HPE Cray EX Hardware Replacement Procedures H-6173* for detailed instructions for replacing liquid-cooled blades ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).

1. Power on the nodes in the source system by repeating the steps starting in the
   [Bring up the blade in the destination system](#bring-up-the-blade-in-the-destination-system) section, and going up through
   the [Check DNS](#check-dns) section.
