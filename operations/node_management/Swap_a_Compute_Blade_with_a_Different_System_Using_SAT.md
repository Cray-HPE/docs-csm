# Swap a Compute Blade with a Different System Using SAT

Swap an HPE Cray EX liquid-cooled compute blade between two systems.

- The two systems in this example are:

  - Source system - Cray EX TDS cabinet `x9000` with a healthy `EX425` blade (Windom dual-injection) in chassis 3, slot 0

  - Destination system - Cray EX cabinet `x1005` with a defective `EX425` blade (Windom dual-injection) in chassis 3, slot 0

- Substitute the correct component names (xnames) or other parameters in the command examples that follow.

## Prerequisites

- The Cray command line interface \(CLI\) tool is initialized and configured on the system. See [Configure the Cray Command Line Interface](../configure_cray_cli.md).

- The Slingshot fabric must be configured with the desired topology for both blades.

- The System Layout Service (SLS) must have the desired HSN configuration.

- The blade that is removed from the source system must be installed in the empty slot left by the blade removed from destination system, and vice-versa.

- Check the status of the high-speed network (HSN) and record link status before the procedure.

- The blades must have the coolant drained and filled during the swap to minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems.

  - Review procedures in *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*
  - Review the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200*

- The System Admin Toolkit \(SAT\) is installed and configured on the system.

## Remove blade from source system

### Source: Prepare the blade for removal

1. Using the work load manager (WLM), drain running jobs from the affected nodes on the blade. Refer to the vendor documentation for the WLM for more information.



1. Determine which Boot Orchestration Service \(BOS\) templates to use to shut down nodes on the target blade.

   There will be separate session templates for UANs and computes nodes.

   1. List all the session templates.

      If it is unclear which session template is in use, proceed to the next substep.

      ```bash
      cray bos sessiontemplate list
      ```

   1. Find the node xnames with `sat status`. In this example, the target blade is in slot `x9000c3s0`.

      ```bash
      sat status --filter 'xname=x9000c3s0*'
      ```

      Example output:

      ```text
      +---------------+------+----------+-------+------+---------+------+-------+-------------+----------+
      | xname         | Type | NID      | State | Flag | Enabled | Arch | Class | Role        | Net      |
      +---------------+------+----------+-------+------+---------+------+-------+-------------+----------+
      | x9000c3s0b1n0 | Node | 1        | Off   | OK   | True    | X86  | River | Compute     | Sling    |
      | x9000c3s0b2n0 | Node | 2        | Off   | OK   | True    | X86  | River | Compute     | Sling    |
      | x9000c3s0b3n0 | Node | 3        | Off   | OK   | True    | X86  | River | Compute     | Sling    |
      | x9000c3s0b4n0 | Node | 4        | Off   | OK   | True    | X86  | River | Compute     | Sling    |
      +---------------+------+----------+-------+------+---------+------+-------+-------------+----------+
      ```

   1. Find the `bos_session` value for each node via the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).

      ```bash
      cray cfs components describe x9000c3s0b1n0 | grep bos_session
      ```

      Example output:

      ```toml
      bos_session = "e98cdc5d-3f2d-4fc8-a6e4-1d301d37f52f"
      ```

   1. Find the required `templateName` value with BOS.

      ```bash
      cray bos session describe BOS_SESSION | grep templateName
      ```

      Example output:

      ```toml
      templateName = "compute-nid1-4-sessiontemplate"
      ```

   1. Determine the list of xnames associated with the desired boot session template.

      ```bash
      cray bos sessiontemplate describe SESSION_TEMPLATE_NAME | grep node_list
      ```

      Example output:

      ```toml
      node_list = [ "x9000c3s0b1n0", "x9000c3s0b2n0", "x9000c3s0b3n0", "x9000c3s0b4n0",]
      ```

1. Shut down the nodes on the target blade.

   Use the `sat bootsys` command to shut down the nodes on the target blade. Specify the appropriate component
   name (xname) for the slot, and a comma-separated list of the BOS session templates determined in the previous step.

   ```bash
   BOS_TEMPLATES=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
   sat bootsys shutdown --stage bos-operations --bos-limit x9000c3s0 --recursive --bos-templates $BOS_TEMPLATES
   ```

### Source: Use SAT to remove the blade from hardware management

1. Power off the slot and delete blade information from HSM.

   Use the `sat swap` command to power off the slot and delete the blade's Ethernet interfaces and Redfish endpoints from HSM.

   ```bash
   sat swap blade --action disable x9000c3s0
   ```

   This command will save the MAC addresses, IP addresses, and node component names (xnames) from the blade to a JSON document. The document is stored in a file with the following naming convention:

   ```text
   ethernet-interface-mappings-<blade_xname>-<current_year>-<current_month>-<current_day>.json
   ```

   If a mapping file already exists with the above name, then a numeric suffix will be appended to the file name in front of the `.json` extension.

   The mapping file should be copied to the NCN on the destination system used for the swap procedure, if necessary. In this example, the
   filename is changed to `ethernet-interface-mappings-src.json` on the destination system for clarity.

   ```bash
   scp ethernet-interface-mappings-x3000c3s0-2022-01-01.json <dest>-ncn-m001:ethernet-interface-mappings-src.json
   ```

### Source: Remove the blade

1. Remove the blade from the source system.
   Review the *Remove a Compute Blade Using the Lift* procedure in *HPE Cray EX Hardware Replacement Procedures H-6173* for detailed instructions for replacing liquid-cooled blades ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).
1. Drain the coolant from the blade and fill with fresh coolant to minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems.
   Review *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*. If using the hand pump, review procedures in the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200* ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).
1. Install the blade from the source system in a storage rack or leave it on the cart.

## Remove blade from destination system

### Destination: Prepare blade for removal

1. Using the work load manager (WLM), drain running jobs from the affected nodes on the blade.

   Refer to the vendor documentation for the WLM for more information.

1. Shut down the nodes on the target blade.

   Use the `sat bootsys` command to shut down the nodes on the target blade. Specify the appropriate component
   name (xname) for the slot and a comma-separated list of the appropriate BOS session templates for the nodes on the blade.

   The appropriate BOS session templates should be determined using the same procedure as was used to [determine the appropriate BOS session templates on the source system](#determine-bos-session-template).

   ```bash
   BOS_TEMPLATES=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
   sat bootsys shutdown --stage bos-operations --bos-limit x1005c0s3 --recursive --bos-templates $BOS_TEMPLATES
   ```

### Destination: Use SAT to remove the blade from hardware management

1. Power off the slot and delete blade information from HSM.

   Use the `sat swap` command to power off the slot and delete the blade's Ethernet interfaces and Redfish endpoints from HSM.

   ```bash
   sat swap blade --action disable x1005c0s3
   ```

   The mapping file should be copied to the NCN on the destination system used for the swap procedure, if necessary. In this example, the
   filename is changed to `ethernet-interface-mappings-src.json` on the destination system for clarity.

   ```bash
   scp ethernet-interface-mappings-x1005c0s3-2022-01-01.json <src>-ncn-m001:ethernet-interface-mappings-dest.json
   ```

## Swap the blade hardware on the destination system

1. Remove the blade from destination system install it in a storage cart.

1. Install the blade from the source system into the destination system.



## Bring up the blade in the destination system

### Destination: Use SAT to add the blade to hardware management

1. Begin discovery for the blade.

   Use the `sat swap` command to map the nodes' Ethernet interface MAC addresses to the appropriate IP addresses and component names (xnames), and begin discovery for the blade.

   The `--src-mapping` and `--dst-mapping` arguments should be used to pass in the Ethernet interface mapping files created during the previous steps.

   ```bash
   sat swap blade --action enable --src-mapping ethernet-interface-mappings-src.json --dst-mapping ethernet-interface-mappings-x1005c0s3-2022-01-01.json x10005c0s3
   ```

### Destination: Power on and boot the nodes

1. Power on and boot the nodes.

   Use `sat bootsys` to power on and boot the nodes. Specify the appropriate BOS template for the node type.

   ```bash
   BOS_TEMPLATE=cos-2.0.30-slurm-healthy-compute
   sat bootsys boot --stage bos-operations --bos-limit x1005c0s3 --recursive --bos-templates $BOS_TEMPLATE
   ```

### Destination: Check firmware

1. Validate the firmware.

   Verify that the correct firmware versions are present for the node BIOS, node controller (nC), NIC mezzanine card (NMC), GPUs, and so on.

1. If necessary, update the firmware.

   Review the [FAS Admin Procedures](../firmware/FAS_Admin_Procedures.md) and [Update Firmware with FAS](../firmware/Update_Firmware_with_FAS.md) procedure.

   ```bash
   cray fas actions create CUSTOM_DEVICE_PARAMETERS.json
   ```

### Destination: Check DVS

There should be a `cray-cps` pod (the broker), three `cray-cps-etcd` pods and their waiter, and at least one `cray-cps-cm-pm` pod. Usually there are two `cray-cps-cm-pm` pods:
one on `ncn-w002` and one on another worker node.

1. Check the `cray-cps` pods on worker nodes and verify they are `Running`.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -Ao wide | grep cps
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   services   cray-cps-75cffc4b94-j9qzf    2/2  Running   0   42h 10.40.0.57  ncn-w001
   services   cray-cps-cm-pm-g6tjx         5/5  Running   21  41h 10.42.0.77  ncn-w003
   services   cray-cps-cm-pm-kss5k         5/5  Running   21  41h 10.39.0.80  ncn-w002
   services   cray-cps-etcd-knt45b8sjf     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.42.0.67  ncn-w003
   services   cray-cps-etcd-n76pmpbl5h     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.39.0.49  ncn-w002
   services   cray-cps-etcd-qwdn74rxmp     1/1  Running   0   42h 10.40.0.42  ncn-w001
   services   cray-cps-wait-for-etcd-jb95m 0/1  Completed
   ```

1. SSH to each worker node running CPS/DVS and run `dmesg -T`.

   Ensure that there are no recurring `"DVS: merge_one"` error messages shown. These error messages indicate that DVS
   is detecting an IP address change for one of the client nodes.

   ```bash
   dmesg -T | grep "DVS: merge_one"
   ```

   ```text
   [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#351: New node map entry does not match the existing entry
   [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#353:   nid: 8 -> 8
   [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#355:   name: 'x3000c0s19b1n0' -> 'x3000c0s19b1n0'
   [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#357:   address: '10.252.0.26@tcp99' -> '10.252.0.33@tcp99'
   [Tue Jul 21 13:09:54 2020] DVS: merge_one#358:   Ignoring.
   ```

1. Make sure the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) finished successfully. Review *HPE Cray Operating System Administration Guide: CSM on HPE Cray EX Systems (S-8024)*.

1. SSH to the node and check each DVS mount.

   ```bash
   nid001133:~ # mount | grep dvs | head -1
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   /var/lib/cps-local/0dbb42538e05485de6f433a28c19e200 on /var/opt/cray/gpu/nvidia-squashfs-21.3 type dvs (ro,relatime,blksize=524288,statsfile=/sys/kernel/debug/dvs/mounts/1/stats,attrcache_timeout=14400,cache,nodatasync,noclosesync,retry,failover,userenv,noclusterfs,killprocess,noatomic,nodeferopens,no_distribute_create_ops,no_ro_cache,loadbalance,maxnodes=1,nnodes=6,nomagic,hash_on_nid,hash=modulo,nodefile=/sys/kernel/debug/dvs/mounts/1/nodenames,nodename=x3000c0s6b0n0:x3000c0s5b0n0:x3000c0s4b0n0:x3000c0s9b0n0:x3000c0s8b0n0:x3000c0s7b0n0)
   ```

   ```bash
   nid001133:~ # ls /var/opt/cray/gpu/nvidia-squashfs-21.3
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   rootfs
   ```

### Destination: Check the HSN for the affected nodes

1. Determine the pod name for the Slingshot fabric manager pod and check the status of the fabric.

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it -n services \
           $(kubectl get pods --all-namespaces |grep slingshot | awk '{print $2}') \
           -- fmn_status
   ```



### Destination: Check DNS

1. Check for duplicate IP address entries in the State Management Database (SMD).

   Duplicate entries will cause DNS operations to fail.

   ```bash
   ssh uan01
   ssh: Could not resolve hostname uan01: Temporary failure in name resolution
   ssh x3000c0s14b0n0
   ssh: Could not resolve hostname x3000c0s14b0n0: Temporary failure in name resolution
   ssh x1000c1s1b0n1
   ssh: Could not resolve hostname x1000c1s1b0n1: Temporary failure in name resolution
   ```

   The Kea configuration error will display a message similar to the message below. This message indicates a duplicate IP address (`10.100.0.105`) in the SMD:

   ```text
   Config reload failed
   [{'result': 1, 'text': "Config reload failed: configuration error using file '/usr/local/kea/cray-dhcp-kea-dhcp4.conf':
   failed to add new host using the HW address '00:40:a6:83:50:a4 and DUID '(null)' to the IPv4 subnet id '0' for the address 10.100.0.105: There's already a reservation for this address"}]
   ```

1. Check Kea for active DHCP leases.

   Use the following example `curl` command to check for active DHCP leases. If there are zero DHCP leases, then there is a configuration error.

   In this example, an authentication token for the API gateway is stored in the `TOKEN` shell variable. See [Retrieve an Authentication Token](../security_and_authentication/Retrieve_an_Authentication_Token.md) for more information.

   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{ "command": "lease4-get-all", "service": [ "dhcp4" ] }' https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/dhcp-kea | jq
   ```

   Example output in the case of a configuration error:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "arguments": {
         "leases": []
       },
       "result": 3,
       "text": "0 IPv4 lease(s) found."
     }
   ]
   ```

1. Delete the duplicate entries, if there are any.

   If there are duplicate entries in the HSM as a result of this procedure, then delete the duplicate entries (`10.100.0.105` in this example).

   1. Show the `EthernetInterfaces` for the duplicate IP address:

      ```bash
      cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces list --ip-address 10.100.0.105 --format json | jq
      ```

      Example output:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "ID": "0040a68350a4",
          "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
          "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:50:a4",
          "IPAddresses": [
            {
              "IPAddress": "10.100.0.105"
            }
          ],
          "LastUpdate": "2021-08-24T20:24:23.214023Z",
          "ComponentID": "x1000c7s7b0n1",
          "Type": "Node"
        },
        {
          "ID": "0040a683639a",
          "Description": "Node Maintenance Network",
          "MACAddress": "00:40:a6:83:63:9a",
          "IPAddresses": [
            {
              "IPAddress": "10.100.0.105"
            }
          ],
          "LastUpdate": "2021-08-27T19:15:53.697459Z",
          "ComponentID": "x1000c7s7b0n1",
          "Type": "Node"
        }
      ]
      ```

   1. Delete the older entry.

      ```bash
      cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete 0040a68350a4
      ```

1. Check DNS using `dnslookup`.

   ```bash
   nslookup 10.252.1.29
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01.
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01.local.
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = x3000c0s14b0n0.
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = x3000c0s14b0n0.local.
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01-nmn.
   1.1.252.10.in-addr.arpa name = uan01-nmn.local.
   ```

   ```console
   nslookup uan01
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   Server:     10.92.100.225
   Address:    10.92.100.225#53

   Name:   uan01
   Address: 10.252.1.29
   ```

   ```console
   nslookup x3000c0s14b0n0
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   Server:     10.92.100.225
   Address:    10.92.100.225#53

   Name:   x3000c0s14b0n0
   Address: 10.252.1.29
   ```

1. Verify the ability to connect using SSH.

   ```bash
   ssh x3000c0s14b0n0
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   The authenticity of host 'x3000c0s14b0n0 (10.252.1.29)' can't be established.
   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:wttHXF5CaJcQGPTIq4zWp0whx3JTwT/tpx1dJNyyXkA.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

## Bring up the blade in the source system

1. To minimize cross-contamination of cooling systems, drain the coolant from the blade removed from destination system and fill with fresh coolant .

   Review the *HPE Cray EX Coolant Service Procedures H-6199*. If using the hand pump, review procedures in the *HPE Cray EX Hand Pump User Guide H-6200* ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).

1. Install the blade from the destination system into source system.

   Review the *Remove a Compute Blade Using the Lift* procedure in *HPE Cray EX Hardware Replacement Procedures H-6173* for detailed instructions for replacing liquid-cooled blades ([HPE Support](https://internal.support.hpe.com/)).

1. Power on the nodes in the source system by repeating the steps starting in the
   [Bring up the blade in the destination system](#bring-up-the-blade-in-the-destination-system) section, and going up through
   the [Check DNS](#check-dns) section.
