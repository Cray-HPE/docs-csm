# Repurpose a Compute Node as a UAN

It is possible to repurpose a compute node to be used as a User Access Node (UAN). This is typically done when the processor type of the compute node is not yet available in a UAN server.

Please see the ***Repurposing a Compute Node as a UAN*** section of the *HPE Cray User Access Node (UAN) Software Administration Guide (S-8033)* for further information.
