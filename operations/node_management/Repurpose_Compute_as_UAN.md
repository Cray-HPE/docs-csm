# Repurpose a Compute Node as a UAN

It is possible to repurpose a compute node to be used as a User Access Node (UAN). This is typically done when the processor type of the compute node is not yet available in a UAN server.

For more information, see the **Repurposing a Compute Node as a UAN** section of the *HPE Cray User Access Node (UAN) Software Administration Guide (`S-8033`)*.
