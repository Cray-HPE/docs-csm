# Prepare Storage Nodes

Prepare a storage node before rebuilding it.

**IMPORTANT:** All of the output examples may not reflect the cluster status where this operation is being performed.
For example, if this is a rebuild in place, then Ceph components will not be reporting down, in contrast to a failed node rebuild.

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Procedure](#procedure)
* [Next step](#next-step)

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the latest CSM documentation RPM is installed on `ncn-m001`.

    See [Check for Latest Documentation](../../../update_product_stream/README.md#check-for-latest-documentation).

1. (`ncn-m001#`) When rebuilding a node, make sure that `/srv/cray/scripts/common/storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh` and `/srv/cray/scripts/common/pre-load-images.sh` have been removed from the `runcmd` in BSS.

    1. Set node name and xname if not already set.

        ```bash
        NODE=ncn-s00n
        XNAME=$(ssh $NODE cat /etc/cray/xname)
        ```

    1. Get the `runcmd` in BSS.

        ```bash
        cray bss bootparameters list --name ${XNAME} --format=json|jq -r '.[]|.["cloud-init"]|.["user-data"].runcmd'
        ```

        Expected output:

        ```json
        [
        "/srv/cray/scripts/metal/net-init.sh",
        "/srv/cray/scripts/common/update_ca_certs.py",
        "/srv/cray/scripts/metal/install.sh",
        "/srv/cray/scripts/common/ceph-enable-services.sh",
        "touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled"
        ]
        ```

        If `/srv/cray/scripts/common/storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh` or `/srv/cray/scripts/common/pre-load-images.sh` is in the `runcmd`, then it will need to be fixed using
        the following procedure:

        1. Obtain an API authentication token.

            A token will need to be generated and made available as an environment variable.
            Refer to the [Retrieve an Authentication Token](../../security_and_authentication/Retrieve_an_Authentication_Token.md) procedure for more information.

        1. Run the following command to patch BSS.

            ```bash
            python3 /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/patch-ceph-runcmd.py
            ```

        1. Repeat the original Cray CLI command and verify that the expected output is obtained.

## Procedure

Upload Ceph container images into Nexus.

1. Log into one of the first three storage NCNs.

    This procedure must be performed on a `ceph-mon`node. By default these will be
    any of the first three storage NCNs: `ncn-s001`, `ncn-s002`, or `ncn-s003`

1. (`ncn-s#`) Copy `upload_ceph_images_to_nexus.sh` from `ncn-m001` and execute it.

    ```bash
    scp ncn-m001:/usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/upload_ceph_images_to_nexus.sh /srv/cray/scripts/common/upload_ceph_images_to_nexus.sh && \
    /srv/cray/scripts/common/upload_ceph_images_to_nexus.sh
    ```

1. (`ncn-s#`) Check the status of Ceph.

    Check the OSD status, weight, and location:

    ```bash
    ceph osd tree
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ID  CLASS  WEIGHT    TYPE NAME          STATUS  REWEIGHT  PRI-AFF
    -1         62.87558  root default

    3    ssd   3.49309          osd.3          up   1.00000  1.00000
    7    ssd   3.49309          osd.7          up   1.00000  1.00000

    13   ssd   3.49309          osd.13         up   1.00000  1.00000
    15   ssd   3.49309          osd.15         up   1.00000  1.00000
    -7         20.95853      host ncn-s003
    1    ssd   3.49309          osd.1          up   1.00000  1.00000
    4    ssd   3.49309          osd.4          up   1.00000  1.00000
    8    ssd   3.49309          osd.8          up   1.00000  1.00000
    11   ssd   3.49309          osd.11         up   1.00000  1.00000
    14   ssd   3.49309          osd.14         up   1.00000  1.00000
    17   ssd   3.49309          osd.17         up   1.00000  1.00000
    ```

1. (`ncn-s#`) If the node is up, then stop and disable all the Ceph services on the node being rebuilt.

    ```bash
    ceph orch maintenance enter <storage node hostname being rebuilt>
    ```

    Example output:

    ```screen
    Daemons for Ceph cluster 5f79a490-c281-11ed-b6ec-fa163e741e89 stopped on host ncn-s003. Host ncn-s003 moved to maintenance mode
    ```

    **IMPORTANT**: The --force flag is used to bypass warnings. These pertain to Ceph services which can handle failures, like `rgw`.  
    * ***IF*** the command returns any lines with an **ALERT** status then please follow the output to remedy.  
      * Typically this will be something like the active MGR process is on that node and it must be failed over first.

    Example:

    ```screen
    WARNING: Stopping 1 out of 1 daemons in Alertmanager service. Service will not be operational with no daemons left. At least 1 daemon must be running to guarantee service.
    ALERT: Cannot stop active Mgr daemon, Please switch active Mgrs with 'ceph mgr fail ncn-s003.ydycwn'
    WARNING: Removing RGW daemons can cause clients to lose connectivity.
    ```

    In this example, the warnings for RGW and Alertmanager would be ignored by passing the `--force` flag. The alert for active `Mgr` will need to be addressed with the provided command (`ceph mgr fail ncn-s003.ydycwn`).

1. (`ncn-s#`) Re-check the OSD status, weight, and location:

    ```bash
    ceph osd tree
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ID  CLASS  WEIGHT    TYPE NAME          STATUS  REWEIGHT  PRI-AFF
    -1         62.87558  root default

    2    ssd   3.49309          osd.2          up   1.00000  1.00000
    5    ssd   3.49309          osd.5          up   1.00000  1.00000

    3    ssd   3.49309          osd.3          up   1.00000  1.00000
    7    ssd   3.49309          osd.7          up   1.00000  1.00000

    15   ssd   3.49309          osd.15         up   1.00000  1.00000
    -7         20.95853      host ncn-s003
    1    ssd   3.49309          osd.1        down   1.00000  1.00000

    8    ssd   3.49309          osd.8        down   1.00000  1.00000
    11   ssd   3.49309          osd.11       down   1.00000  1.00000
    14   ssd   3.49309          osd.14       down   1.00000  1.00000
    17   ssd   3.49309          osd.17       down   1.00000  1.00000
    ```

1. (`ncn-s#`) Check the status of the Ceph cluster:

    ```bash
    ceph -s
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
      cluster:
        id:     4c9e9d74-a208-11ed-b008-98039bb427f6

                1 host is in maintenance mode           <-------- Expect this line.
                1/3 mons down, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002
                6 osds down

      io:
        client:   8.7 KiB/s rd, 353 KiB/s wr, 3 op/s rd, 53 op/s wr
    ```

1. (`ncn-s#`) List down Ceph OSDs.

    **IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding, ensure that this rebuild requires OSD wipes. Storage node rebuilds that are done on an active node do not require the OSD removal. Some examples are rebuilds to get some a custom patched image.

    The `ceph osd tree` capture indicated that there are down OSDs on `ncn-s003`.

    ```bash
    ceph osd tree down
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    ID  CLASS  WEIGHT    TYPE NAME          STATUS  REWEIGHT  PRI-AFF
    -1         62.87758  root default
    -7         20.95853      host ncn-s003
     1    ssd   3.49309          osd.1        down   1.00000  1.00000
     4    ssd   3.49309          osd.4        down   1.00000  1.00000
     8    ssd   3.49309          osd.8        down   1.00000  1.00000
     11   ssd   3.49309          osd.11       down   1.00000  1.00000
     14   ssd   3.49309          osd.14       down   1.00000  1.00000
     17   ssd   3.49309          osd.17       down   1.00000  1.00000
    ```

1. (`ncn-s#`) Remove the OSD references to allow the rebuild to re-use the original OSD references on the drives.
  
    By default, if the OSD reference is not removed, then there will still a reference to them in the CRUSH map.
    This will result in OSDs that no longer exist appearing to be down.

    The following command assumes the variables from [the prerequisites section](Rebuild_NCNs.md#prerequisites) are set.

    ```bash
    for osd in $(ceph osd ls-tree $NODE); do ceph osd destroy osd.$osd --force; ceph osd purge osd.$osd --force; done
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    destroyed osd.1
    purged osd.1
    destroyed osd.4
    purged osd.4
    destroyed osd.6
    purged osd.6
    destroyed osd.11
    purged osd.11
    destroyed osd.14
    purged osd.14
    destroyed osd.17
    purged osd.17
    ```

## Next step

If executing this procedure as part of an NCN rebuild, then return to the main [Rebuild NCNs](Rebuild_NCNs.md#storage-node) page and proceed with the next step.
