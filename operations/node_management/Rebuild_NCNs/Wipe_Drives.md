# Wipe Drives

**WARNING:** This is the point of no return. Once the disks are wiped, the node must be rebuilt.

All commands in this section must be run on the node being rebuilt \(unless otherwise indicated\). These commands can be done from the ConMan console window.

Only follow the steps in the section for the node type that is being rebuilt:

  - [Wipe Disks: Master](#wipe-disks-master)
  - [Wipe Disks: Worker Node](#wipe-disks-worker-node)
  - [Wipe Disks: Utility Storage Node](#wipe-disks-utility-storage-node)

## Wipe Disks: Master

1. Unmount the etcd volume and remove the volume group.

   **NOTE:** etcd should already be stopped as part of the "Prepare Master Node" steps.

   ```bash
   /run/lib-etcd
   vgremove -f etcdvg0-ETCDK8S
   ```

2. Unmount the `SDU` mountpoint and remove the volume group.

   ```bash
   umount /var/lib/sdu
   vgremove -f metalvg0-CRAYSDU
   ```

3. Wipe the drives

   ```bash
   mdisks=$(lsblk -l -o SIZE,NAME,TYPE,TRAN | grep -E '(sata|nvme|sas)' | sort -h | awk '   {print "/dev/" $2}')
   wipefs --all --force $mdisks
   ```

## Wipe Disks: Worker Node

1. Stop `containerd` and wipe drives.

    ```bash
    systemctl stop containerd.service
    ```

1. Unmount partitions.

    ```bash
    umount /var/lib/kubelet
    umount /run/lib-containerd
    umount /run/containerd
    ```

1. Wipe the drives.

    ```bash
    wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
    ```

## Wipe Disks: Utility Storage Node

1. Stop running OSDs on the node being wiped.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
    ```

2. Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running after running the first command.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
    ncn-s# vgremove -f --select 'vg_name=~ceph*'
    ```

3. Unmount and remove the metalvg0 volume group.

   ```bash
   umount /etc/ceph
   umount /var/lib/ceph
   umount /var/lib/containers
   vgremove -f metalvg0
   ```

4. Wipe the disks and RAIDs.

    ```bash
    wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
    ```
