# Defragment NID Numbering

This procedure will rearrange NIDs for specified compute nodes to create a numerically (NID) and lexicographically (xname) contiguous block of NIDs at the specified start point.

It is recommended that the system be taken down for maintenance while performing this procedure.

This procedure should only be performed if absolutely required. Some reasons for needing to perform this procedure include:

1. Compute nodes were added to SLS with incorrect NID numbering, missing node entries, and/or extra node entries.

2. Compute nodes were permanently moved, removed, or reprovisioned and there is a desire to remove NID numbering gaps.

The example in this procedure removes NID gaps from 2 cabinets of compute nodes that were a result of incorrect numbering in SLS.

## Prerequisites

* Hardware State Manager's (HSM) inventory data is up to date (Hardware has not changed since the previous discovery).
* Chassis-level entries exist in the System Layout Service (SLS) and are correct for all Mountain and Hill chassis.
* All compute nodes are powered off.

## Defragment NID Script Functionality and Limitations

In the process of defragmenting NIDs, the defragment_nids.py script will:

* Update the NID numbers for compute node entries in HSM.
* Update/create SLS compute node entries with correct NID numbering and aliases.
* Remove node entries from HSM that were not previously removed due to missed blade swap procedure steps. This includes associated entries under `/State/Components`, `/Inventory/ComponentEndpoints`, `/Inventory/Hardware`, and `/Inventory/EthernetInterfaces`.
* Remove SLS node entries with conflicting NIDs that are not in HSM.
* Correct the _Class_ designation of compute nodes in HSM.

Limitations of the defragment_nids.py script:

* Only affects compute nodes.
* HSM node entries are only removed if the "leftover" nodes are of a different model than the existing nodes in the same slot.
* SLS node entries that don't exist in HSM are only removed if their NID falls within the specified NID block.

## NID Defragmentation Procedure

### Step 1: Run defragment_nids.py

1. Choose the starting NID for the NID block (e.g., 1000).

```bash
    export NID_START=1000
```

2. Choose the components to include in the NID block (e.g., x1000,x3000). This can be specified at cabinet (x#), chassis (x#c#), slot (x#c#s#), or even node level (x#c#s#b#n#). This list always gets expanded to include all compute nodes contained by the specified parent components.

```bash
    export INCLUDE_LIST=x1000,x3000
```

3. Run defragment_nids.py.
**NOTE:** You can do a dryrun of defragment_nids.py to print out a report of what will happen without affecting the system's NID numbering by specifying `--dryrun`.

```bash
    /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/defragment_nids.py --start ${NID_START} --include ${INCLUDE_LIST} | jq .
```

### Step 2: Perform Reload of DVS/LNet Service

DVS node maps on NCN worker nodes and gateway nodes have entries of compute nodes that include their NIDs. Thus, the NID defragmentation process will impact the NCN worker and gateway nodes.

Carry out the _Procedure To Perform After CSM Defragmentation of Compute Node Identifiers_ documented in publication _HPE Cray Operating System Administration Guide: CSM on HPE Cray EX Systems_.

## Troubleshooting

### Discovery Errors

The defragment_nids.py script checks for HSM discovery errors on the specified nodes before proceeding. It will return an error if any are found. For example:

```bash
{
    "Message": "Discovery errors detected.",
    "Severity": "Error",
    "IDs": ["x1000c0s1b1", "x3000c0s6b0"]
}
```

To continue with the NID defragmentation you must first debug any discovery errors such that all specified components have a discovery status of `DiscoverOK` in HSM.

See [Troubleshoot Issues with Redfish Endpoint Discovery](Troubleshoot_Issues_with_Redfish_Endpoint_Discovery.md) for debugging discovery issues.

Alternately, if these issues are known and will not affect the desired resulting NID numbering, the `--ignore-discovery-errors` option may be specified with defragment_nids.py to continue through these errors.

**Warning:** Continuing through discovery errors may result in incorrect NID numbering if HSM's inventory data for those nodes is missing or incorrect.

### Invalid NID Range

The defragment_nids.py script checks for nodes with NIDs that fall within the specified NID block that are not specified in the include list. An example of this error is:

```bash
{
    "Message": "There is an unexpected node NID in the requested NID range, 1000-1100",
    "Severity": "Error",
    "IDs": ["x3001c0s0b0n0", "x3001c0s0b0n1"]
}
```

These might be NCNs and UANs or compute nodes that were not covered by the specified include list. Here are some scenarios and how to fix them:

1. Computes nodes in cabinets x1000 and x1002 where specified in the include list so the new NID block is 1000-1100 but the compute nodes in cabinet x1001 have NIDs 1090-1140. This would create a conflict so defragment_nids.py will return an error. This can be fixed by:

    * Changing the starting NID for the new NID block (e.g., 1200).
    * Include x1001 in the include list to include it in the new NID block.
    * Run defragment_nids.py to first move the computes nodes in x1001 to another NID block then rerun defragment_nids.py for the compute nodes in cabinets x1000 and x1002.

2. Computes nodes in cabinet x1000 where specified in the include list so the new NID block is 1000-1100 but x1000c1b0n0 is a UAN that was given the NID 1000. This would create a conflict so defragment_nids.py will return an error. This can be fixed by:

    * Changing the starting NID for the new NID block (e.g., 1001).
    * Manually change the NID of the UAN in HSM and SLS then rerun defragment_nids.py for the nodes in x1000.

3. Computes nodes in cabinet x1000 where specified in the include list so the new NID block is 1000-1100 but x3000c0b0n0 is an NCN that was given the NID 1000. This would create a conflict so defragment_nids.py will return an error. It is not recommended to try and change the NID of an NCN. The best course of action is to change the starting NID for the new NID block.
