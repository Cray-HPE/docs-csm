# Validate Health

## Description

Validate that the system is healthy

## Procedure

The following procedures can be run from any master or worker node.

1. Collect data about the system management platform health.

   ```bash
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnPostgresHealthChecks.sh
   ```

   **NOTE:**
   If workers have been removed and the worker count is currently at two, the following failures can be ignored. A re-check will be needed once workers are added and the count returns to three or above.
   - the ncnPostgresHealthChecks may report `Unable to determine a leader` and one of the three Postgres pods may be in Pending state.
   - the ncnHealthChecks may report `Error from server...FAILED - Pod Not Healthy`, `FAILED DATABASE CHECK` and one of the three Etcd pods may be in Pending state.

1. Restart the goss server on all the NCNs. Adjust the commands based on the number of master, worker and storage nodes.

   ```bash
   ncn-mw# pdsh -w ncn-m00[1-3],ncn-w00[1-3],ncn-s00[1-3] systemctl restart goss-servers
   ```

1. Collect data about the various sub-systems.

   ```bash
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-healthcheck-master
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-healthcheck-worker
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-healthcheck-storage
   ncn-mw# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/automated/ncn-kubernetes-checks 
   ```

   **NOTE:**
   The following errors can be ignored `Server URL: http://$NODE ... ERROR: Server endpoint could not be reached`, if $NODE has been removed and it is one of the first three worker, master or storage nodes.

   **NOTE:**
   If workers have been removed and the worker count is currently at two, the following failures can be ignored. A re-check will be needed once workers are added and the count returns to three or above.
   - Verify cray etcd is healthy
