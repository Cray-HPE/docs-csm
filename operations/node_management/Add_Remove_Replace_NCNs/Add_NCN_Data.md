# Add NCN Data

## Description

Add NCN data to System Layout Service (SLS), Boot Script Service (BSS), and Hardware State Manager (HSM) as needed, in order to add an NCN to the system.

Scenarios where this procedure is applicable:
1. Adding a management NCN that has not previously been in the system before:
   - Add an additional NCN to an existing cabinet
   - Add an NCN that is being replaced by another NCN of the same type and in the same slot
   - Adding a new NCN that replaces an NCN removed from the system in a different location

1. Adding a management NCN that has been present in the system previously:
   - Adding an NCN that was previously removed from the system to move it to a new location

## Procedure
1.  Retrieve an API token:

    ```bash
    ncn-m# export TOKEN=$(curl -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
            -d client_id=admin-client -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth \
            -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
            https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token \
            | jq -r '.access_token')
    ```

1.  Collect the following information from the NCN:
    1.  Determine the xname of the NCN by referring to the HMN of the system's SHCD file, if it has not been determined yet.

        Sample row from the `HMN` tab of an SHCD file:

        | Source (J20)    | Source Rack (K20) | Source Location (L20) | (M20) | Parent (N20) | (O20)| Source Port (P20) | Destination (Q20) | Destination Rack (R20) | Destination Location (S20) | (T20) | Destination Port (U20) |
        | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
        | wn01            | x3000             | u04                   | -     |              |      | j3                | sw-smn01          | x3000                  | u14                        | -     | j48                    |

        > The `Source` name for a worker NCN would be in the format `wn01`; master NCNs have format `mn01` and storage NCNs have format `sn01`.

        Node xname format: xXcCsSbBnN

        |   |                | SHCD Column to reference | Description
        | - | -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- 
        | X | Cabinet number | SourceRack (K20)         | The Cabinet or rack number containing the Management NCN.
        | C | Chassis number |                          | For air-cooled nodes the chassis is 0.
        | S | Slot/Rack U    | Source Location (L20)    | The Slot of the node is determined by the bottom most rack U that node occupies.
        | B | BMC number     |                          | For Management NCNs the BMC number is 0.
        | N | Node number    |                          | For Management NCNs the Node number is 0.

        ```bash
        ncn-m# export XNAME=x3000c0s4b0n0
        ```
    
    1.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Determine the NCN BMC xname by removing the trailing `n0` from the NCN node xname:

        ```bash
        ncn-m# export BMC_XNAME=x3000c0s4b0
        ```

    1.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Determine the xname of the `MgmtSwitchConnector` (the switch port of the management switch that the BMC is connected to). This is not required for `ncn-m001`, because its BMC is typically connected to the site network.

        Sample row from the HMN tab of an SHCD:

        | Source (J20)    | Source Rack (K20) | Source Location (L20) | (M20) | Parent (N20) | (O20)| Source Port (P20) | Destination (Q20) | Destination Rack (R20) | Destination Location (S20) | (T20) | Destination Port (U20) |
        | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
        | wn01            | x3000             | u04                   | -     |              |      | j3                | sw-smn01          | x3000                  | u14                        | -     | j48                    |

        `MgmtSwitchConnector` xname format: xXcCwWjJ

        |   |                    | SHCD Column to reference   | Description
        | - | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----
        | X | Cabinet number     | Destination Rack (R20)     | The Cabinet or rack number containing the management NCN.
        | C | Chassis number     |                            | For air-cooled management switches the chassis is 0.
        | W | Slot/Rack U        | Destination Location (S20) | The Slot/Rack U that the management switch occupies.
        | J | Switch port number | Destination Port (U20)     | The switch port on the switch that the NCN BMC is cabled to.

        ```bash
        ncn-m# export MGMT_SWITCH_CONNECTOR=x3000c0w14j48
        ```

    1.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Determine the xname of the management switch by removing the trailing `jJ` from the `MgmtSwitchConnector` xname:
        ```bash
        ncn-m# export MGMT_SWITCH=x3000c0w14
        ```
 
    1.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Collect the BMC MAC address.
        -   If the NCN was previously in the system, recall the BMC MAC address recorded from the [Remove NCN Data](Remove_NCN_Data.md) procedure.

        -   Alternatively, view the MAC address table on the management switch that the BMC is cabled to.
            
            1.  Determine the alias of the management switch that the BMC is connected to:
                ```bash
                ncn-m# cray sls hardware describe $MGMT_SWITCH --format json | jq .ExtraProperties.Aliases[] -r
                ```

                Example output:

                ```text              
                sw-leaf-bmc-001
                ```

            1.  SSH into the management switch that the BMC is connected to:
                ```bash
                ncn-m# ssh admin@sw-leaf-bmc-001.hmn
                ```

            1.  Locate the switch port that the BMC is connected to and record its MAC address. In the commands below, change the value of `1/1/39` to match the BMC switch port number (the BMC Switch port number is the `J` value in the in the `MgmtSwitchConnector` xname `xXwWjJ`).
                > For example, with the following `$MGMT_SWITCH_CONNECTOR` value:
                > ```bash
                > ncn-m# echo $MGMT_SWITCH_CONNECTOR
                > ```
                >
                > Example output:
                > ```
                > x3000c0w14j39
                > ```
                >
                > The switch port number for the above `MgmtSwitchConnector` xname would be `39`, so use `1/1/39` instead of `1/1/48` in the commands below.

                __Dell Management Switch__

                ```
                sw-leaf-bmc-001# show mac address-table | grep 1/1/48
                ```

                Example output:

                ```text
                4	a4:bf:01:65:68:54	dynamic		1/1/48
                ```

                __Aruba Management Switch__

                ```
                sw-leaf-bmc-001# show mac-address-table | include 1/1/48
                ```

                Example output:

                ```text
                a4:bf:01:65:68:54    4        dynamic                   1/1/48
                ```

    1.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Set the `BMC_MAC` environment variable to the BMC MAC address:  
        ```bash
        ncn-m# export BMC_MAC=a4:bf:01:65:68:54
        ```
    
    1. **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Determine the current IP address of the NCN BMC:

        1.  Query Kea for the BMC MAC address to determine its current IP address:

            ```bash
            ncn-m# export BMC_IP=$(curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "command": "lease4-get-all", "service": [ "dhcp4" ] }' https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/dhcp-kea | jq --arg BMC_MAC $BMC_MAC '.[].arguments.leases[] | select(."hw-address" == $BMC_MAC)."ip-address"' -r)
            ncn-m# echo $BMC_IP
            ```

            Example output:

            ```
            10.254.1.26
            ```

            **Troubleshooting**
            If the MAC addresses of the BMC are not present in Kea, then check for the following items:
            1. Verify that the BMC is powered up and has an active connection to the network.
            1. Verify that the BMC is set to DHCP instead of a static IP address.

        1.  Ping the BMC to see if it is reachable:

            ```bash
            ncn-m# ping $BMC_IP
            ```

    1.  **Perform this step if adding `ncn-m001`, otherwise skip:** Set the `BMC_IP` environment variable to the current IP address or hostname of the BMC. This is not the allocated HMN address for the BMC of `ncn-m001`.

        ```bash
        ncn-m# export BMC_IP=10.0.0.10
        ```

    1.  Collect NCN MAC addresses for the following interfaces if they are present. Depending on the hardware present, not all of the following interfaces will be present. The collected MAC addresses will be used later in this procedure with the `add_management_ncn.py` script.

        Depending on the hardware present in the NCN, not all of these interfaces may be present.
        -   NCNs will have either 1 or 2 management PCIe NIC cards (2 or 4 PCIe NIC ports).
        -   It is expected that only worker NCNs have HSN interfaces.

        __NCN with a single PCIe card (1 card with 2 ports)__

        | Interface   | CLI Flag      | Required MAC Address     | Description
        | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------
        | `mgmt0`     | `--mac-mgmt0` | Required                 | First MAC address of Bond 1.
        | `mgmt1`     | `--mac-mgmt1` | Required                 | Second MAC address of Bond 0.
        | `hsn0`      | `--mac-hsn0`  | Required for Worker NCNs | MAC address of the first High Speed Network NIC. Master and Storage NCNs do not have HSN NICs.
        | `hsn1`      | `--mac-hsn1`  | Optional for Worker NCNs | MAC address of the second High Speed Network NIC. Master and Storage NCNs do not have HSN NICs.
        | `lan0`      | `--mac-lan0`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the first non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan1`      | `--mac-lan1`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the second non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan2`      | `--mac-lan2`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the third non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan3`      | `--mac-lan3`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the forth non-bond or HSN-related interface.

        __NCN with a dual PCIe cards (2 cards with 2 ports each for 4 ports total)__

        | Interface   | CLI Flag      | Required MAC Address     | Description
        | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------
        | `mgmt0`     | `--mac-mgmt0` | Required                 | TODO
        | `mgmt1`     | `--mac-mgmt1` | Required                 | TODO
        | `sun0`      | `--mac-sun0`  | Required                 | TODO
        | `sun1`      | `--mac-sun0`  | Required                 | TODO
        | `hsn0`      | `--mac-hsn0`  | Required for Worker NCNs | MAC address of the first High Speed Network NIC. Master and Storage NCNs do not have HSN NICs.
        | `hsn1`      | `--mac-hsn1`  | Optional for Worker NCNs | MAC address of the second High Speed Network NIC. Master and Storage NCNs do not have HSN NICs.
        | `lan0`      | `--mac-lan0`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the first non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan1`      | `--mac-lan1`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the second non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan2`      | `--mac-lan2`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the third non-bond or HSN-related interface.
        | `lan3`      | `--mac-lan3`  | Optional                 | MAC address for the forth non-bond or HSN-related interface.

        
        1.  **If the NCN being added is being moved to a new location in the system**, then these MAC addresses can be retrieved from backup files generated by the [Remove NCN Data](Remove_NCN_Data.md) procedure.

            Recall the previous node xname of the NCN being added:

            ```bash
            ncn-m# export PREVIOUS_XNAME=REPLACE_WITH_OLD_XNAME
            ```

            Retrieve the MAC address for the NCN from the backup files:

            ```bash
            ncn-m# cat /tmp/remove_management_ncn/$PREVIOUS_XNAME/bss-bootparameters-$PREVIOUS_XNAME.json |
                   jq .[].params -r | tr " " "\n" | grep ifname
            ```

            Example output for a worker node with a single management PCIe NIC card:

            ```text
            ifname=hsn0:50:6b:4b:23:9f:7c
            ifname=lan1:b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9
            ifname=lan0:b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8
            ifname=mgmt0:a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa
            ifname=mgmt1:a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab
            ```

            Using the example output from above, derive the following CLI flags for a worker NCN:

            | Interface | MAC Address         | CLI Flag
            | --------- | ------------------- | -------- 
            | `mgmt0`   | `a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa` | `--mac-mgmt0=a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa`
            | `mgmt1`   | `a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab` | `--mac-mgmt1=a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab`
            | `lan0`    | `b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8` | `--mac-lan0=b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8`
            | `lan1`    | `b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9` | `--mac-lan1=b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9`
            | `hsn0`    | `50:6b:4b:23:9f:7c` | `--mac-hsn0=50:6b:4b:23:9f:7c`

        2. **Otherwise** the NCN MAC addresses need to be collected using the [Collect NCN MAC Addresses](Collect_NCN_MAC_Addresses.md) procedure.
  
2. Perform a dry run of the `add_management_ncn.py` script in order to determine if any validation failures occur:

    > Update the following command with the MAC addresses and interfaces that were collected from the NCN.

    * If adding a node other than `ncn-m001`:

        ```bash
        ncn-m# cd /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/Add_Remove_Replace_NCNs/
        ncn-m# ./add_management_ncn.py ncn-data \
                    --xname $XNAME \
                    --alias $NODE \
                    --bmc-mgmt-switch-connector $MGMT_SWITCH_CONNECTOR \
                    --mac-bmc $BMC_MAC \
                    --mac-mgmt0 a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa \
                    --mac-mgmt1 a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab \
                    --mac-hsn0 50:6b:4b:23:9f:7c \
                    --mac-lan0 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8 \
                    --mac-lan1 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9
        ```

    * If adding `ncn-m001`, omit the `--bmc-mgmt-switch-connector` and `--mac-bmc` arguments, because its BMC is connected to the site network:

        ```bash
        ncn-m# cd /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/Add_Remove_Replace_NCNs/
        ncn-m# ./add_management_ncn.py ncn-data \
                    --xname $XNAME \
                    --alias $NODE \
                    --mac-mgmt0 a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa \
                    --mac-mgmt1 a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab \
                    --mac-lan0 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8 \
                    --mac-lan1 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9
        ```

3.  Add the NCN to SLS, HSM, and BSS.

    Run the `add_management_ncn.py` script again, adding the `--perform-changes` argument to the command run in the previous step:

    For example:
    ```bash
    ncn-m# ./add_management_ncn.py ncn-data \
        --xname $XNAME \
        --alias $NODE \
        --bmc-mgmt-switch-connector $MGMT_SWITCH_CONNECTOR \
        --mac-bmc $BMC_MAC \
        --mac-mgmt0 a4:bf:01:65:6a:aa \
        --mac-mgmt1 a4:bf:01:65:6a:ab \
        --mac-hsn0 50:6b:4b:23:9f:7c \
        --mac-lan0 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e8 \
        --mac-lan1 b8:59:9f:d9:9d:e9 \
        --perform-changes
    ```

    Example output:
    ```

    > Depending on the networking configuration of the system the CMN or CAN networks may not be present in SLS network data. If CMN or CAN networks do not exist in SLS, then no IP will be allocated for that network. 


4.  **If the following text is present** at the end of the `add_management_ncn.py` script output, then the NCN BMC was given an IP address by DHCP, and it is not at the expected IP address.
    Sample output when the BMC has an unexpected IP address.

    ```text
    x3000c0s3b0n0 (ncn-m002) has been added to SLS/HSM/BSS
        WARNING The NCN BMC currently has the IP address: <$BMC_IP>, and needs to have IP address X.Y.Z.W
    ```

    Restart the BMC to pick up the expected IP address:
    
    > `read -s` is used to read the password in order to prevent it from being echoed to the screen or recorded in the shell history.
    
    ```bash
    ncn-m# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD
    ncn-m# export IPMI_PASSWORD
    ncn-m# ipmitool -U root -I lanplus -E -H $BMC_IP mc reset cold
    ncn-m# sleep 60
    ```

5.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Verify that the BMC is reachable at the expected IP address:
    ```bash
    ncn-m# ping $NODE-mgmt
    ```

    Wait 5 minutes for Kea and the Hardware State Manager to sync. If `ping` continues to fail, re-run the previous step to restart the BMC.

6.  Restart the REDS deployment:
    ```bash
    ncn-m# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-reds
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```text
    deployment.apps/cray-reds restarted
    ```

7.  Wait for REDS to restart:
    ```bash
    ncn-m# kubectl -n services rollout status  deployment cray-reds
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```text
    Waiting for deployment "cray-reds" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
    Waiting for deployment "cray-reds" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
    deployment "cray-reds" successfully rolled out
    ```

8.  **Skip if adding `ncn-m001`:** Wait for the NCN BMC to get discovered by HSM:
    > If the BMC of `ncn-m001` is connected to the site network, then we will be unable to discover the BMC, because it is not connected via the HMN network.
    ```bash
    ncn-m# watch -n 0.2 "cray hsm inventory redfishEndpoints describe $BMC_XNAME --format json" 
    ```

    Wait until the `LastDiscoveryAttempt` field is `DiscoverOK`:
    ```json
    {
        "ID": "x3000c0s38b0",
        "Type": "NodeBMC",
        "Hostname": "",
        "Domain": "",
        "FQDN": "x3000c0s38b0",
        "Enabled": true,
        "UUID": "cc48551e-ec22-4bef-b8a3-bb3261749a0d",
        "User": "root",
        "Password": "",
        "RediscoverOnUpdate": true,
        "DiscoveryInfo": {
            "LastDiscoveryAttempt": "2022-02-28T22:54:08.496898Z",
            "LastDiscoveryStatus": "DiscoverOK",
            "RedfishVersion": "1.7.0"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    __Discovery troubleshooting__
    The `redfishEndpoint` may cycle between `DiscoveryStarted` and `HTTPsGetFailed` before the endpoint becomes `DiscoverOK`. If the BMC is in `HTTPSGetFailed` for a long period of time, then the following steps may help to determine the cause:
    -   Verify that the xname of the BMC resolves in DNS:
        ```bash
        ncn-m# nslookup x3000c0s38b0
        ```

        Expected output:

        ```text
        Server:		10.92.100.225
        Address:	10.92.100.225#53

        Name:	x3000c0s38b0.hmn
        Address: 10.254.1.13
        ```
    
    -   Verify that the BMC is reachable at the expected IP address:
        ```bash
        ncn-m# ping $NODE-mgmt
        ```

    -   Verify that the BMC Redfish `v1/Managers` endpoint is reachable.
        ```bash
        ncn-m# curl -k -u root:changeme https://x3000c0s38b0/redfish/v1/Managers
        ```

9. Verify that the NCN exists under HSM State Components:
    ```bash
    ncn-m# cray hsm state components describe $XNAME
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    ID = "x3000c0s11b0n0"
    Type = "Node"
    State = "Off"
    Flag = "OK"
    Enabled = true
    Role = "Management"
    SubRole = "Worker"
    NID = 100006
    NetType = "Sling"
    Arch = "X86"
    Class = "River"
    ```
