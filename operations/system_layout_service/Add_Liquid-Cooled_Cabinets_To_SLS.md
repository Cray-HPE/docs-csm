# Add Liquid-Cooled Cabinets to SLS

This procedure adds one or more liquid-cooled cabinets and associated CDU management switches to SLS.

**`NOTES`**

- This procedure is intended to be used in conjunction with the top level [Add additional Liquid-Cooled Cabinets to a System](../node_management/Add_additional_Liquid-Cooled_Cabinets_to_a_System.md) procedure.

**`NOTE`** This procedure will only add the liquid-cooled hardware present in an EX2500 cabinet with a single liquid-cooled chassis and one air-cooled chassis.

## Prerequisites

- The Cray command line interface \(CLI\) tool is initialized and configured on the system.
- Collect information for the liquid-cooled cabinets being added to the system. For each cabinet collect:
  - Cabinet component name (xname) (for example `x1004`)
  - Hardware Management Network (HMN) VLAN ID configured on the CEC (for example `3004`)
  - Node Management Network (NMN) VLAN ID configured on the CEC (for example `2004`)
  - Starting compute node ID (NID) (for example `2025`)
  - Cabinet Type: Mountain (8 chassis) or Hill (2 chassis)

- Collect information for the CDU switches (if any) being added to the system. For each CDU management switch, collect:
  - CDU switch component name (xname) (for example `d1w1`)
  - CDU switch brand (for example Dell or Aruba)
  - CDU switch alias (for example `sw-cdu-004`)

## Procedure

1. (`ncn-m#`) Perform an SLS dump state operation:

    ```bash
    cray sls dumpstate list --format json > sls_dump.json
    cp sls_dump.json sls_dump.original.json
    ```

1. **For each** new liquid-cooled cabinet being added to the system, collect the following information about each cabinet:

    - Cabinet component name (xname) (for example `x1004`)
    - Hardware Management Network (HMN) VLAN ID configured on the CEC (for example `3004`)
    - Node Management Network (NMN) VLAN ID configured on the CEC (for example `2004`)
    - Starting compute node ID (NID) (for example `2025`)
    - Cabinet Type (Mountain (8 Chassis) or Hill (2 Chassis))

    > The `inspect_sls_cabinets.py` script can be used to help display information about existing cabinets present in the system:

    > ```bash
    > /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/system_layout_service/inspect_sls_cabinets.py sls_dump.json

1. **For each** new CDU switch being added to the system, collect the following information about it:

    - CDU switch component name (xname)
      - If located within a CDU: `dDwW`
            - `dD` : where `D` is the Coolant Distribution Unit (CDU)
            - `wW` : where `W` is the management switch in a CDU
      - If located in a standard rack: `xXcChHsS`
        - `xX` : where `X` is the River cabinet identification number (the figure above is `3000`)
        - `cC` : where `C` is the chassis identification number. This should be `0`.
          - If the switch is within an air-cooled cabinet this should be `0`.
          - If the switch is located within a air-cooled chassis in an EX2500 cabinet, then this should be `4`.
        - `hH` : where `H` is the slot number in the cabinet (height).
        - `sS` : where `S` is the horizontal space number.
    - CDU switch brand (for example Dell or Aruba)
    - CDU switch alias (for example `sw-cdu-004` )

1. (`ncn-m#`) **For each** new CDU switch, add it to the SLS state dump taken in step 1 in **ascending order** based on the switch alias:

    ```bash
    /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/system_layout_service/add_cdu_switch.py sls_dump.json \
        --cdu-switch d1w1 \

    Writing updated SLS state to sls_dump.json
    ```

1. (`ncn-m#`) Inspect the differences between the original SLS state file and the modified one.

    ```bash
    diff sls_dump.original.json sls_dump.json
    ```

1. (`ncn-m#`) Perform an SLS load state operation to replace the contents of SLS with the data from the `sls_dump.json` file.

    Get an API Token:

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(curl -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
                          -d client_id=admin-client \

    ```

    Perform the load state operation:

    ```bash
    curl -s -k -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X POST -F sls_dump=@sls_input_file.json \
        https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/sls/v1/loadstate
    ```

1. MEDS will automatically start looking for potential hardware in the newly added liquid-cooled cabinets.

   > **`NOTE`**: No hardware in these new cabinets will be discovered until the management network has been reconfigured to support the new cabinets, and routes have been added to the management NCNs in the system.
