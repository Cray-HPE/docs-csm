# Manage Node Consoles

TODO Add headers: About this task, Role, Objective, Limitations, New in this Release
TODO Add content from Admin guide.  Need to include section restart conman daemon in cray-conman pod to find new nodes.  And more descriptions about node console logs and use of conman for interactive console access.  Some of this is in the 008-CSM-VALIDATION file.
