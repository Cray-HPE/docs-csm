# Troubleshoot ConMan Asking for Password on SSH Connection

If ConMan starts to ask for a password when there is an SSH connection to the node on liquid-cooled hardware, that usually indicates there is a problem with the SSH key that was established on the node BMC. The key may have been replaced or overwritten on the hardware.

Use this procedure to renew or reinstall the SSH key on the BMCs.

## Prerequisites

This procedure requires administrative privileges.

## Procedure

> **`NOTE`** this procedure has changed since the CSM 0.9 release.

1. Scale the `cray-console-operator` pods to 0 replicas.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services scale --replicas=0 deployment/cray-console-operator
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    deployment.apps/cray-console-operator scaled
    ```

1. Verify that the `cray-console-operator` service is no longer running.

    The following command will give no output when the pod is no longer running.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services get pods | grep console-operator
    ```

1. Delete the SSH keys in a `cray-console-node` pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services exec -it cray-console-node-0 -c cray-console-node \
        -- rm -v /var/log/console/conman.key /var/log/console/conman.key.pub
    ```

1. Restart the `cray-console-operator` pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n services scale --replicas=1 deployment/cray-console-operator
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    deployment.apps/cray-console-operator scaled
    ```

    It may take some time to regenerate the keys and get them deployed to the BMCs, but in a while the console connections using SSH should be reestablished. Note that it may be worthwhile to determine how the SSH key was modified and establish site procedures to coordinate SSH key use; otherwise they may be overwritten again at a later time.
