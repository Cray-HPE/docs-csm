# Package Repository Management

Repositories are added to systems to extend the system functionality beyond what is initially delivered. The Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager is the primary method for
repository management. Nexus hosts the Yum, Docker, `raw`, and Helm repositories for software and firmware content.

Refer to the following for more information about Nexus:
