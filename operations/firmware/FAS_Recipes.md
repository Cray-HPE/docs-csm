## Recipes

The following example JSON files are useful to reference when updating specific hardware components. In all of these examples, the `overrideDryrun` field will be set to `false`; set them to `true` to perform a live update.

When updating an entire system, walk down the device hierarchy component type by component type, starting first with 'Routers' (switches), proceeding to Chassis, and then finally to Nodes. While this is not strictly necessary, it does help eliminate confusion.

Refer to [FAS Filters](FAS_Filters.md) for more information on the content used in the example JSON files.

### Manufacturer : Cray

<a name="cray-device-type-chassisbmc-target-bmc"></a>

#### Device Type: ChassisBMC | Target: BMC

**IMPORTANT**: Before updating a CMM, make sure all slot and rectifier power is off. The hms-discovery job must also be stopped before updates and restarted after updates are complete.

* Stop hms-discovery job: `kubectl -n services patch cronjobs hms-discovery -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'`
* Start hms-discovery job: `kubectl -n services patch cronjobs hms-discovery -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'`

<a name="cray-device-type-nodebmc-target-nodebios"></a>

#### Device Type: NodeBMC | Target: NodeBIOS

**IMPORTANT:**
* The Nodes themselves must be powered **off** in order to update the BIOS on the nodes. The BMC will still have power and will perform the update.
* When the BMC is updated or rebooted after updating the Node0.BIOS and/or Node1.BIOS liquid-cooled nodes, the node BIOS version will not report the new version string until the nodes are powered back on. It is recommended that the Node0/1 BIOS be updated in a separate action, either before or after a BMC update and the nodes are powered back on after a BIOS update. The liquid-cooled nodes must be powered off for the BIOS to be updated.

```json
{
"stateComponentFilter": {

    "deviceTypes": [
      "nodeBMC"    ]
  },
"inventoryHardwareFilter": {

    "description": "Dryrun upgrade of Node BIOS"
  }
}
```

**NOTE:** If this update does not work as expected, follow the [Compute Node BIOS Workaround for HPE CRAY EX425](FAS_Use_Cases.md#cn-workaround) procedure.


<a name="cray-device-type-nodebmc-target-redstone-fpga"></a>

#### Device Type: NodeBMC | Target: Redstone FPGA

**IMPORTANT:**
* The Nodes themselves must be powered **on** in order to update the firmware of the Redstone FPGA on the nodes.
* If updating FPGAs fails because of "No Image available", update using the "Override an Image for an Update" procedure in [FAS Admin Procedures](FAS_Admin_Procedures.md). Find the imageID using the following command: `cray fas images list --format json | jq '.[] | .[] | select(.target=="Node0.AccFPGA0")'`

    "deviceTypes": [
      "nodeBMC"    ]

  }
}
```

<a name="hpe-device-type-nodebmc-target--aka-bios"></a>

#### Device Type: NodeBMC | Target: `System ROM` aka BIOS

**IMPORTANT:**
* If updating the System ROM of an NCN, the NTP and DNS server values will be lost and must be restored. For NCNs **other than ncn-m001** this can be done using the `/opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/set-bmc-ntp-dns.sh` script. Use the `-h` option to get a list of command line options required to restore the NTP and DNS values.
See [Configure DNS and NTP on Each BMC](../../install/redeploy_pit_node.md#configure-dns-and-ntp-on-each-bmc)
* Node should be powered on for System ROM update and will need to be rebooted to use the updated BIOS.


```json
{
"stateComponentFilter": {
    "deviceTypes": [
      "NodeBMC"
    ]
},
"inventoryHardwareFilter": {
    "manufacturer": "hpe"
    },
"targetFilter": {
    "targets": [
      "System ROM"
    ]
  },
"command": {
    "version": "latest",
    "tag": "default",
    "overrideDryrun": false,
    "restoreNotPossibleOverride": true,
    "timeLimit": 1000,
    "description": "Dryrun upgrade of HPE node system rom"
  }
}
```

**NOTE:**
* Update of System ROM may report as an error when it actually succeeded because of an incorrect string in the image metadata in FAS. Manually check the update version to get around this error.

#### Device Type: NodeBMC | Target: BMC


```json
{
"stateComponentFilter": {

    "deviceTypes": [
      "nodeBMC"
    ]
},
"inventoryHardwareFilter": {
    "manufacturer": "gigabyte"
    },
"targetFilter": {
    "targets": [
      "BMC"
    ]
  },
"command": {
    "version": "latest",
    "tag": "default",
    "overrideDryrun": false,
    "restoreNotPossibleOverride": true,
    "timeLimit": 4000,
    "description": "Dryrun upgrade of Gigabyte node BMCs"
  }
}
```

**NOTE:** The timeLimit is `4000` because the Gigabytes can take a lot longer to update.

You may receive a node failed to update with the output:
`stateHelper = "Firmware Update Information Returned Downloading â€“ See /redfish/v1/UpdateService"`
FAS has incorrectly marked this node as failed.
It most likely will complete the update successfully.
You can check the update status by looking at the Redfish `FirmwareInventory (/redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory/BMC)`
or rerunning FAS to verify that the BMC firmware was updated.
Make sure you have waited for the current firmware to be updated before starting a new FAS action on the same node.
