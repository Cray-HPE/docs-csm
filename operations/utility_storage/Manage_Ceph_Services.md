# Manage Ceph Services

The following commands are required to start, stop, or restart Ceph services. Restarting Ceph services is helpful for troubleshoot issues with the utility storage platform.

## List Ceph Services

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch ps
```

Example output:

## Ceph Monitor Service (ceph-mon)

**IMPORTANT:** All of the below ceph orch commands should be run from `ncn-s001/2/3` or `ncn-m001/2/3`.

Start the ceph-mon service:

> **`NOTE`** The mon process can have a container ID appended to the end of the host name. Please use the output from above to ensure the correct name is used.

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon start mon.<hostname>
```

Stop the ceph-mon service:

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon stop mon.<hostname>
```

Restart the ceph-mon service:

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon restart mon.<hostname>
```

## Ceph OSD Service (ceph-osd)

Start the ceph-osd service:

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon start osd.<number>
```

Stop the ceph-osd service:

```bash
nncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon stop osd.<number>
```

Restart the ceph-osd service:

```

Restart the rados-gateway:

```bash
ncn-s00(1/2/3)# ceph orch daemon restart rgw.site1.<container id from ceph orch ls>
```

## Ceph Service Restart using CEPHADM

> **IMPORTANT:** The following commands need to run from the host where services are being started or stopped.

- Get the service system_unit:

   ```bash
   cephadm ls
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
      {
         "style": "cephadm:v1",
         "name": "mgr.ncn-s001",
         "fsid": "01a0d9d2-ea7f-43dc-af25-acdfa5242a48",
         "systemd_unit": "ceph-01a0d9d2-ea7f-43dc-af25-acdfa5242a48@mgr.ncn-s001",
         "enabled": false,
         "state": "running",
         "container_id": "ad887936d37fd87999b140c366ef288443faf03e869219bdd282b5825be14d6e",
         "container_image_name": "registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8",
         "container_image_id": "5553b0cb212ca2aa220d33ba39d9c602c8412ce6c5febc57ef9cdc9c5844b185",
         "version": "15.2.8",
         "started": "2021-06-17T22:41:45.132838Z",
         "created": "2021-06-17T22:17:51.063202Z",
         "deployed": "2021-06-17T22:16:03.898845Z",
         "configured": "2021-06-17T22:41:07.807004Z"
      },
   ```

- Restart the service:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart ceph-01a0d9d2-ea7f-43dc-af25-acdfa5242a48@mgr.ncn-s001
   ```

## Ceph Manager Modules

**Location:** Ceph manager modules can be enabled or disabled from any ceph-mon nodes.

Enable Ceph manager modules:

```bash
ceph mgr MODULE_NAME enable MODULE
```

Disable Ceph manager modules:

```bash
ceph mgr MODULE_NAME disable MODULE
```

## Scale Ceph Services

Ceph has the ability to deploy/scale/reconfigure/redeploy Ceph processes down and back up to restart the services.

> **IMPORTANT:** When scaling the Ceph manager daemon (mgr.hostname.\<containerid>), keep in mind that there must be a running manager daemon as it is what is controlling the orchestration processes.


> **IMPORTANT:** osd.all-available-devices cannot be scaled; this is the process to auto-discover available OSDs.


> **IMPORTANT:** The crash service cannot be scaled; this is the equivalent of a Kubernetes daemon set and runs on all nodes to collect crash data.

The following example shows scaling the mgr service down and back up.

### Prerequisites

Two SSH sessions are required. One to do the work from and another that is running `watch ceph -s` to monitor the progress.

### Procedure

  1. List the services.

     ```bash
     ceph orch ls
     ```

     Example output:

     ```bash
     NAME                       RUNNING  REFRESHED  AGE  PLACEMENT                                                      IMAGE NAME                        IMAGE ID
     crash                          6/6  9s ago     4d   *                                                              registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c
     mds.cephfs                     3/3  9s ago     4d   ncn-s001;ncn-s002;ncn-s003;count:3                             registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c
     mgr                            3/3  9s ago     4d   ncn-s001;ncn-s002;ncn-s003;count:3                             registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c
     mon                            3/3  9s ago     4d   ncn-s001;ncn-s002;ncn-s003;count:3                             registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c
     osd.all-available-devices      6/6  9s ago     4d    *                                                              registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8   5553b0cb212c
     rgw.site1                3/3  9s ago     4d   ncn-s001;ncn-s002;ncn-s003;ncn-s004;ncn-s005;ncn-s006;count:3  registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c

     ```

     (Optional) Limit the results.

      Syntax: `ceph orch [<service_type>] [<service_name>] [--export] [plain|json|json-pretty|yaml] [--refresh]`

      ```bash
      ceph orch ls mgr
      ```

      Example output:

      ```bash
      NAME  RUNNING  REFRESHED  AGE  PLACEMENT                           IMAGE NAME                        IMAGE ID
      mgr       3/3  17s ago    4d   ncn-s001;ncn-s002;ncn-s003;count:3  registry.local/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8  5553b0cb212c
      ```

      The placement of the services is retrieved with this command.

  2. Choose the service to scale. ***(reminder the example will use the MGR service)***

     1. If scaling mds or mgr daemons, make sure to fail over the active mgr/mds daemon so there is always one running.

         ```bash
         # To get the active MDS

         ceph fs status -f json-pretty|jq -r '.mdsmap[]|select(.state=="active")|.name'

         cephfs.ncn-s001.juehkw <-- current active MDS. note this will change when you fail it over so keep this command handy

         # To get the active MGR

         ceph mgr dump | jq -r .active_name

         ncn-s002.fumzfm  <-- current active MGR. note this will change when you fail it over so keep this command handy
         ```

      Now, the service, current placement policy, and if applicable, the active MGR/MDS daemon are all known.

  3. Scale the service.

     ```bash
     ceph orch apply --placement="1 <host where the active mgr is running>"
     ```

     For example:

     ```bash
     ceph orch apply mgr --placement="1 ncn-s002"
     Scheduled mgr update...
     ```

  4. Watch the SSH session that is showing the Ceph status (`ceph -s`).

     ```bash
     ceph -s
     ```

     Example output:

     ```bash
     cluster:
      id:     11d5d552-cfac-11eb-ab69-fa163ec012bf
      health: HEALTH_OK

     services:
      mon: 3 daemons, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002,ncn-s003 (age 70s)
      mgr: ncn-s002.fumzfm(active, since 14s)
      mds: cephfs:1 {0=cephfs.ncn-s001.juehkw=up:active} 1 up:standby-replay 1 up:standby
      osd: 6 osds: 6 up (since 4d), 6 in (since 4d)
      rgw: 2 daemons active (site1.zone1.ncn-s005.hzfbkd, site1.zone1.ncn-s006.vjuwkf)

     task status:

     data:
      pools:   7 pools, 193 pgs
      objects: 256 objects, 7.5 MiB
      usage:   9.1 GiB used, 261 GiB / 270 GiB avail
      pgs:     193 active+clean

     io:
      client:   663 B/s rd, 1 op/s rd, 0 op/s wr

     ```

     The mgr service is now showing 1 active on the node we chose.

  5. Scale the service back up to 3 mgrs.

     ```bash
     ceph orch apply mgr --placement="3 ncn-s001 ncn-s002 ncn-s003"
     ```

     The returned output will be "Scheduled mgr update...".

  6. When the Ceph status output shows there are 3 running mgr daemons, scale the last daemon back down and up.

     **If it is the MDS or MGR daemons, then REMEMBER we have to fail over the active daemon.**

      ```bash
      ceph mgr fail ncn-s002.fumzfm   # This was our active MGR.
      ```

     In the Ceph status output, the will be an ACTIVE ceph mgr process change.

     ```bash
     mgr: ncn-s003.wtvbtz(active, since 2m), standbys: ncn-s001.cgbxdw
     ```

  7. Scale the service back to its original deployment size.

     ```bash
     ceph orch apply mgr  --placement="3 ncn-s001 ncn-s002 ncn-s003"
     ```

     The returned output will be "Scheduled mgr update...".

  8. Monitor the Ceph status to make sure all the daemons come back online.
