# Troubleshoot if RGW Health Check Fails

Use this procedure to determine why the rgw health check failed and what needs to be fixed.

## Procedure

In the goss test output, look at the value of `x` in `Expected \< int \>: x` (possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Based on the value, navigate to the corresponding numbered item below for troubleshooting this issue.

Optional: Manually run the rgw health check script to see descriptive output.

```bash
ncn-m001# GOSS_BASE=/opt/cray/tests/install/ncn /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/scripts/rgw_health_check.sh
```


1. A value of `1` is returned if unable to connect to `rgw-vip`. This happens if any of the following three commands fail.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# curl -i -s -S -k https://rgw-vip.nmn
    ncn-m001# curl -i -s -S http://rgw-vip.nmn
    ncn-m001# curl -i -s -S http://rgw-vip.hmn
    ```
    Log into a storage node and look at the version and status of Ceph.
    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph --version
    ncn-s# ceph -s
    ```


1. A value of `2` is returned if a storage node is not able to be reached. In this case, run the `rgw_health_check.sh` as stated in the optional step above. Find which storage nodes are not able to be reached, and run the following checks on those nodes.

    - Check if `HAProxy` is running on the node.

        ```bash
        ncn-s# systemctl status haproxy
        ```
        If `HAProxy` is not running, restart it and check the status again.
        ```bash
        ncn-s# systemctl restart haproxy
        ncn-s# systemctl status haproxy
        ```

    - Check if `keepalived` is running on the node.

        ```bash
        ncn-s# systemctl status keepalived.service
        ```
        If `keepalived` is not running, restart it and check the status again.
        ```bash
        ncn-s# systemctl restart keepalived.service
        ncn-s# systemctl status keepalived.service
        ```

    - Check if the `ceph-rgw` daemon is running.
        ```bash
        ncn-s# ceph -s | grep rgw
        ```
        If the `ceph-rgw` daemon is not running on 3 storage nodes, restart the deamon and watch it come up within a few seconds.

        ```bash
        ncn-s# ceph orch ps | grep rgw           #use this to wach the daemon start
        ncn-s# ceph orch daemon restart <name>
        ```


1. A value of `3` is returned if a 'craysys' command fails. This implies 'cloud-init' is not healthy. Run the command below to determine the health.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# cloud-init query -a
    ```

    If the command above fails, reinitialize 'cloud-init' using the following command.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# cloud-init init
    ```


1. If a value of `4` or `5` is returned, then `rgw-vip` and the storage nodes are reachable. The error occurred when attempting to create a bucket, upload an object to a bucket, or download an object from a bucket. This implies Ceph may be unhealthy. Check Ceph status with the following command.

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph -s
    ```

    If Ceph reports any status other than "HEALTH_OK", refer to [Utility Storage](Utility_Storage.md) for general Ceph troubleshooting.
