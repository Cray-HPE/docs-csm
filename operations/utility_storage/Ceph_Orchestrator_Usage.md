# Ceph Orchestrator Usage

The Ceph orchestrator provides a centralized interface for the management of the Ceph cluster. It orchestrates ceph-mgr modules that interface with external orchestration services.

Refer to the external [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/mgr/orchestrator/) for more information.
 
The orchestrator manages Ceph clusters with the following capabilities:

* Single command upgrades (assuming all images are in place)
* Reduces the need to be on the physical server to address a large number of ceph service restarts or configuration changes
* Better integration with the Ceph Dashboard (Coming soon)
* Ability to write custom orchestration modules

## Troubleshoot Ceph Orchestrator

### Watch `cephadm` Log Messages

Watching log messages is useful when making changes with the orchestrator, such as add/remove/scale services or upgrades.

```bash
ncn-s# ceph -w cephadm
```

To watch log messages with debug:

```bash
ncn-s# ceph config set mgr mgr/cephadm/log_to_cluster_level debug
ncn-s# ceph -W cephadm --watch-debug
```

> **NOTE:** For use with orchestration tasks, this can be typically run from a node running the ceph mon process (typically ncn-s00(1/2/3)). There may be cases where a cephadm is run locally on a host and it will be more efficient to tail /var/log/ceph/cephadm.log.



## Usage Examples

This section will provide some in-depth usage with examples of the more commonly used `ceph orch` subcommands.

### List Service Deployments

**`FILTERS:`** Apply filters by adding `--service_type <service type>` or `--service_name <service name>`.

**`Reference Key:`**

1. PLACEMENT - Represents a service deployed on all nodes. Otherwise the listed placement is where it is expected to be deployed.
2. NAME - The deployment name.  this is a generalized name to reference the deployment. This is being noted as additional subcommands the name is more specific to the actual deployed daemon.

### Ceph Daemon start|stop|restart|reconfig

> **NOTE:** The service name is from `ceph orch ps` **NOT** `ceph orch ls`.

```bash
ncn-s# ceph orch daemon restart alertmanager.ncn-s001
Scheduled to restart alertmanager.ncn-s001 on host 'ncn-s001'
```

Monitor the restart using the `ceph orch ps` command and the time associated with the `STATUS` should be reset and show "running (time since started)."

### Deploy or Scale Services

> **NOTE:** The service name is from `ceph orch ls` **NOT** `ceph orch ps`.

```bash
ncn-s# ceph orch apply alertmanager --placement="2 ncn-s001 ncn-s002"
Scheduled alertmanager update...
```

**`Reference Key:`**

1. PLACEMENT - This will show the nodes and the count. If only specifying `--placement="2"`, then it will automatically pick where to put it.

> **IMPORTANT:** There are several combinations available when working with the placement. For example, a placement of 1 can be specified, but then a list of a sub-set of nodes can be used. This is a good way to contain the process to those nodes.

> **IMPORTANT:** This is not available for any deployments with a `PLACEMENT` of *

## General Use

Update the size or placement for a service or apply a large YAML spec:

```bash
ncn-s# ceph orch apply [mon|mgr|rbd-mirror|crash|alertmanager|grafana|node-exporter|prometheus] [<placement>] [--dry-run] [plain|json|json-pretty|yaml] [--unmanaged]

```

Report configured backend and its status:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch status [plain|json|json-pretty|yaml]
```

Check service versions vs available and target containers:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch upgrade check [<image>] [<ceph_version>]
```

Pause an in-progress upgrade:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch upgrade pause
```

Resume paused upgrade:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch upgrade resume
```

Initiate upgrade:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch upgrade start [<image>] [<ceph_version>]
```

Check service versions vs available and target containers:

```bash
ncn-s# cephorch upgrade status
```
