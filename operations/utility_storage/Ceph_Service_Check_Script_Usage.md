# Ceph Service Check Script Usage 

A new Ceph service script that will check the status of ceph and then verify that status against the individual Ceph storage nodes.

## Location

`/opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/scripts/ceph-service-status.sh`

## Usage

```bash
usage:  ceph-service-status.sh # runs a simple ceph health check
        ceph-service-status.sh -n <node> -s <service> # checks a single service on a single node
        ceph-service-status.sh -n <node> -a true # checks all Ceph services on a node
        ceph-service-status.sh -A true # checks all Ceph services on all nodes in a rolling fashion
        ceph-service-status.sh -s <service name> # will find the where the service is running and report its status
```

> **Important:** By default, the output of this command will not be verbose. This is to accommodate goss testing. For manual runs, please use the `-v true` flag.

**Troubleshooting** If the message `parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 5` is displayed, it is indicating that the cached SSH keys in known_hosts are no longer valid. The simple fix is `> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` and re-run the script. It will update the keys.

## Examples

### Simple Ceph Health Check

```bash
# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/scripts/ceph-service-status.sh -v true
```

Example output:

```

### Service Check for All Services and All Nodes

The output of the following command is similar to the above output, except it shows all services on all nodes.
It is excluded in this case for brevity. 

```bash
# /opt/cray/tests/install/ncn/scripts/ceph-service-status.sh  -v true -A true
```

> **IMPORTANT:** This script can be run without the verbose flag and with an echo for the return code `echo $?`.  rc = 0 clean check, rc = 1 or greater then there was an issue and re-run with the `-v true` flag.
