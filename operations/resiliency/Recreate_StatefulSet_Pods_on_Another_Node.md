# Recreate StatefulSet Pods on Another Node

Some pods are members of StatefulSets, meaning that there is a very specific number of them, each likely running on a different node. Similar to DaemonSets, these pods will never be recreated on another node as long as they are sitting in a `Terminating` state.

**Warning:** This procedure should only be done for pods that are known to no longer be running. Corruption may occur if the worker node is still running when deleting the deleting the StatefulSet pod in a `Terminating` state.

The design of StatefulSet pods prohibits the creation of new pods on another node. This is the expected behavior for StatefulSet pods. In many cases, the StatefulSet is a set of only one pod. If a StatefulSet pod needs to be recreated on another node, the `Terminating` pod needs to be force deleted and then it will automatically recreate.

This procedure prevents services from being taken out of service when a node goes down.

### Prerequisites

-   A StatefulSet pod failed to be moved to another healthy non-compute node \(NCN\) acting as a worker node.
-   If the network is being brought down temporarily during testing, ignore any issues with StatefulSet pods until the testing is complete. These errors should be ignored because the nodes could have the network restored, and then the `Terminating` pod may go `ACTIVE` temporarily \(causing a race and corruption\) if it comes up at the same time as another StatefulSet running the pod. This is much more likely to occur during testing of a network outage.

### Procedure

1.  View the StatefulSet pods on the system.

    Any of the pods with `x/1` in the READY column could be on a node that goes down, at which point that service will no longer be available.

    ```bash
    kubectl get statefulsets -A
    ```

1.  Describe a service to find the StatefulSet pod name.

    The StatefulSet pod will have a name in the StatefulSet-0 format. Vault is the service being described in the example below. The StatefulSet pod name is cray-vault-0.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep SERVICE_NAME
    ```

    Example output:

    ```

    ```

1.  Delete the StatefulSet pod in a `Terminating` state.

    The StatefulSet \(the controller\) will recreate the pod on a working node when the pod or the node it sits on is deleted. The command below assumes the pod is located on the downed node and is currently in a `Terminating` state.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod -n NAMESPACE POD_NAME --force --grace-period 0
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod -n vault cray-vault-0 --force --grace-period 0
    ```

    The StatefulSet will then recreate cray-vault-0 on a node that is in `Ready` state.
