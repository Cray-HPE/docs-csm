# Upgrade CSM and additional products with IUF

**Note: From CSM 1.6, CSM supports upgrade through IUF. All CSM-specific steps mentioned in [Upgrade CSM manually and additional products with IUF](upgrade_csm_manual_and_additional_products_with_iuf.md) are now part of CSM Upgrade with IUF.**

All stages of `iuf` are executed in this option. All of the new product software provided in the
recipe release is deployed and all [management NCNs](../../../glossary.md#management-nodes) and managed
[compute nodes](../../../glossary.md#compute-node-cn) and [application nodes](../../../glossary.md#application-node-an) are
rebooted to new images and [Configuration Framework Service (CFS)](../../../glossary.md#configuration-framework-service-cfs)
configurations. Manual operations are documented for procedures that are not currently managed by IUF.

The upgrade workflow comprises the following procedures. The diagram shows the workflow and
the steps below it provide detailed instructions which must be executed in the order shown.
