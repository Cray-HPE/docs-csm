# Prepare for the install or upgrade

This section defines environment variables and directory content that is used throughout the workflow.

## 1. Prepare for the install or upgrade

1. Create timestamped media, activity, and administrator directories on `ncn-m001`.

    The following environment variables are used throughout the workflow:

    | Name               | Recommended Value                              | Description                                                                               |
    | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `${ACTIVITY_NAME}` | Use a short descriptor for the activity        | String identifier for the IUF activity and the `iuf -a` argument for all `iuf` commands   |
    | `${MEDIA_DIR}`     | `/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/"${ACTIVITY_NAME}"`     | Directory containing product distribution files                                           |
    | `${ACTIVITY_DIR}`  | `/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/iuf/"${ACTIVITY_NAME}"` | Directory containing IUF activity logs and state                                          |
    | `${ADMIN_DIR}`     | `/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/admin`                  | Directory containing files that define default values and site preferences for IUF, e.g. `product_vars.yaml` and `site_vars.yaml` |

    (`ncn-m001#`) Create a typescript and set environment variables that will be used later in the install or upgrade workflow. The example value of `${ACTIVITY_NAME}` can be changed as needed.

    ```bash
    script -af iuf-install.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
    ACTIVITY_NAME=update-products
    MEDIA_DIR=/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/media/"${ACTIVITY_NAME}"
    ACTIVITY_DIR=/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/iuf/"${ACTIVITY_NAME}"
    ADMIN_DIR=/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/admin
    mkdir -p "${ACTIVITY_DIR}" "${MEDIA_DIR}" "${ADMIN_DIR}"
    ```

Once this step has completed:

- Environment variables have been set and required IUF directories have been created

## 2. Use of `iuf activity`

**`NOTE`** This section is informational only. There are no operations to perform.

IUF can record time spent performing operations associated with an IUF activity. While `iuf` automatically records all `iuf run` operations within an IUF activity, any other administrative operations can also be recorded within an
IUF activity by using [`iuf activity`](../IUF.md#activity). The following example shows how to record the time spent downloading HPE software and associate it with an IUF activity:

(`ncn-m001#`) Example use of `iuf activity` to record time spent downloading media

```bash
iuf -a "${ACTIVITY_NAME}" activity --create --comment "downloading product media" in_progress
<download HPE product media>
iuf -a "${ACTIVITY_NAME}" activity --create --comment "download complete" waiting_admin
```

The install and upgrade workflow instructions will not use `iuf activity` in this manner, deferring to the administrator to use it as desired.

## 3. Next steps

- If performing an initial install or an upgrade of non-CSM products only, return to the IUF [Initial install](initial_install.md) workflow to continue the install.

- If performing an upgrade that includes upgrading CSM, return to the IUF [Upgrade](upgrade.md) workflow to continue the upgrade.
