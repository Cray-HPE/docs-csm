# `post-install-check`

The `post-install-check` stage validates that the managed compute and application nodes deployed by the preceding `managed-nodes-rollout` stage are executing correctly. It primarily executes pre- and post-stage hook scripts
provided by products in their `iuf-product-manifest.yaml` file.
