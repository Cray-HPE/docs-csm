# `pre-install-check`

The `pre-install-check` stage ensures that CSM is operating properly so that products can be installed. It verifies that S3 storage is functional, that CFS, VCS, and IMS microservices are functional, etc. Products may
provide hook scripts to perform additional product-specific system checks.
