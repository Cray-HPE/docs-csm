# `deliver-product`

The `deliver-product` stage delivers the content provided in the product distribution files to the system. The versioned product catalog entry for each product is updated as the new content is uploaded.

`deliver-product` details are explained in the following sections:

- [Impact](#impact)
- [Input](#input)
- [Execution details](#execution-details)
- [Example](#example)

## Impact

The `deliver-product` stage does not change the running state of the system as the new content has been uploaded, but not deployed.

## Input

The following arguments are most often used with the `deliver-product` stage. See `iuf -h` and `iuf run -h` for additional arguments.

| Input    | `iuf` Argument | Description                                            |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Activity | `-a ACTIVITY`  | Activity created for the install or upgrade operations |
| Site variables                         | `-sv SITE_VARS`             | Path to YAML file containing site defaults and any overrides                 |
| Recipe variables                       | `-rv RECIPE_VARS`           | Path to YAML file containing recipe variables provided by HPE                |
| `sat bootprep` configuration directory | `-bpcd BOOTPREP_CONFIG_DIR` | Directory containing `sat bootprep` configuration files and recipe variables |

## Execution details

The code executed by this stage exists within IUF. See the `deliver-product` entry in `/usr/share/doc/csm/workflows/iuf/stages.yaml` and the corresponding files in `/usr/share/doc/csm/workflows/iuf/operations/`
for details on the commands executed.

Artifacts will be uploaded to the following locations based on entries specified in the products' `iuf-product-manifest.yaml` files.
