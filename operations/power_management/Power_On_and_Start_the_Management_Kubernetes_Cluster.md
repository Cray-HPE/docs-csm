# Power On and Start the Management Kubernetes Cluster

Power on and start management services on the HPE Cray EX management Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

* All management rack PDUs are connected to facility power and facility power is on.
* An authentication token is required to access the API gateway and to use the `sat` command. See the "SAT Authentication" section of the HPE Cray EX System Admin Toolkit (SAT)
  product stream documentation (`S-8031`) for instructions on how to acquire a SAT authentication token.

## Procedure

1. If necessary, power on the management cabinet CDU and chilled doors.

1. Set all management cabinet PDU circuit breakers to `ON` \(all cabinets that contain Kubernetes master nodes, worker nodes, or storage nodes\).

1. Power on the HPE Cray EX cabinet PDUs and standard rack cabinet PDUs.

    Be sure that management switches in all racks and CDU cabinets are powered on and healthy.

1. From a remote system, start the Lustre file system, if it was stopped.

1. (`remote#`) Activate the serial console window to `ncn-m001`.

    > `read -s` is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.

    ```bash
    USERNAME=root
    read -r -s -p "ncn-m001 BMC ${USERNAME} password: " IPMI_PASSWORD
    ```

    > In the example commands below, replace `NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME` with the hostname of the BMC of `ncn-m001`.

    ```bash
    export IPMI_PASSWORD
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME sol activate
    ```

1. (`remote#`) In a separate window, power on the master node 1 \(`ncn-m001`\) chassis using IPMI tool.

    > `read -s` is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.

    ```bash
    USERNAME=root
    read -r -s -p "ncn-m001 BMC ${USERNAME} password: " IPMI_PASSWORD
    ```

    > In the example commands below, replace `NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME` with the hostname of the BMC of `ncn-m001`.

    ```bash
    export IPMI_PASSWORD
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME chassis power on
    ```

    Wait for the login prompt.

    If `ncn-m001` boots into the PIT node, then perform the following procedure:

    1. Set boot order to boot from disk.

        See [NCN Boot Workflow](../../background/ncn_boot_workflow.md).

    1. (`pit#`) Shutdown the PIT node.

        ```bash
        shutdown -h now
        ```

    1. (`remote#`) Power cycle again to boot into `ncn-m001`.

         > In the example commands below, replace `NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME` with the hostname of the BMC of `ncn-m001`.

        ```bash
        ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H NCN_M001_BMC_HOSTNAME chassis power on
        ```

1. (`remote#`) Wait for `ncn-m001` to boot, then `ping` the node to check status.

    ```bash
    ping NCN_M001_HOSTNAME
    ```

1. (`remote#`) Log in to `ncn-m001` as `root`.

   ```bash
   ssh root@NCN_M001_HOSTNAME
   ```

### Power on all other management NCNs

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Power on and boot other management NCNs.

    Note that the default timeout for booting each group of NCNs is 300 seconds, which is reasonable for smaller systems.
    To avoid needing to re-run the command in the event of a timeout, increase the timeout using the `--ncn-boot-timeout` option.
    See `sat bootsys boot --help` for additional information and options.

   ```bash
   sat bootsys boot --stage ncn-power
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   IPMI username: root
   IPMI password:
   The following Non-compute Nodes (NCNs) will be included in this operation:
   managers:
   - ncn-m002
   - ncn-m003
   storage:
   - ncn-s001
   - ncn-s002
   - ncn-s003
   workers:
   - ncn-w001
   - ncn-w002
   - ncn-w003

   The following Non-compute Nodes (NCNs) will be excluded from this operation:
   managers:
   - ncn-m001
   storage: []
   workers: []

   Are the above NCN groupings and exclusions correct? [yes,no] yes

   Powering on NCNs and waiting up to 300 seconds for them to be reachable via SSH: ncn-m002, ncn-m003
   Waiting for condition "Hosts accessible via SSH" timed out after 300 seconds
   ERROR: Unable to reach the following NCNs via SSH after powering them on: ncn-m003, ncn-s002.. Troubleshoot the issue and then try again.
   ```

   In the preceding example, the `ssh` command to the NCN nodes timed out and reported `ERROR` messages. Repeat the above step until you see `Succeeded with boot of other management NCNs.` Each iteration should get further in the process.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Monitor the consoles for each NCN.

    Use `tail` to monitor the log files in `/var/log/cray/console_logs` for each NCN.

    Alternatively, attach to the screen session \(screen sessions real time, but not saved\):

    ```bash
    screen -ls
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    There are screens on:
    26745.SAT-console-ncn-m003-mgmt (Detached)
    26706.SAT-console-ncn-m002-mgmt (Detached)
    26666.SAT-console-ncn-s003-mgmt (Detached)
    26627.SAT-console-ncn-s002-mgmt (Detached)
    26589.SAT-console-ncn-s001-mgmt (Detached)
    26552.SAT-console-ncn-w003-mgmt (Detached)
    26514.SAT-console-ncn-w002-mgmt (Detached)
    26444.SAT-console-ncn-w001-mgmt (Detached)
    ```

    ```bash
    screen -x 26745.SAT-console-ncn-m003-mgmt
    ```

### Verify access to Lustre file system

Verify that the Lustre file system is available from the management cluster.

### Start Kubernetes and other services

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Start the Kubernetes cluster.

    Note that the default timeout for Ceph to become healthy is 600 seconds, which is excessive. To work
    around this issue, set the timeout to a more reasonable value (like 60 seconds) using the `--ceph-timeout`
    option, as shown below.

    ```bash
    sat bootsys boot --stage platform-services --ceph-timeout 60
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    The following Non-compute Nodes (NCNs) will be included in this operation:
    managers:
    - ncn-m001
    - ncn-m002
    - ncn-m003
    storage:
    - ncn-s001
    - ncn-s002
    - ncn-s003
    workers:
    - ncn-w001
    - ncn-w002
    - ncn-w003

    Are the above NCN groupings correct? [yes,no] yes
    ```

    The `sat bootsys boot` command may fail with a message like the following:

    ```text
    Executing step: Start inactive Ceph services, unfreeze Ceph cluster and wait for Ceph health.
    Waiting up to 60 seconds for Ceph to become healthy after unfreeze
    Waiting for condition "Ceph cluster in healthy state" timed out after 60 seconds
    ERROR: Fatal error in step "Start inactive Ceph services, unfreeze Ceph cluster and wait for Ceph health." of platform services start: Ceph is not healthy. Please correct Ceph health and try again.
    ```

    (`ncn-m001#`) If a failure like the above occurs, then see the info-level log messages for
    details about the Ceph health check failure. Depending on the configured log
    level for SAT, the log messages may appear in `stderr`, or only in the log
    file. For example:

    ```bash
    grep "fatal Ceph health warnings" /var/log/cray/sat/sat.log | tail -n 1
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    2021-08-04 17:28:21,945 - INFO - sat.cli.bootsys.ceph - Ceph is not healthy: The following fatal Ceph health warnings were found: POOL_NO_REDUNDANCY
    ```

    The particular Ceph health warning may vary. In this example, it is `POOL_NO_REDUNDANCY`.

    If the warning is `PG_NOT_DEEP_SCRUBBED`, this alert should clear once Ceph deep scrubs of PGs
    have completed. The time to complete this operation depends on the number of outstanding deep
    scrub operations and the load on the Ceph cluster. See [Ceph Deep
    Scrubs](../utility_storage/Ceph_Deep_Scrubs.md) for more information on deep scrubs. This alert
    is more likely to occur if the system is powered off for an extended duration.

    See [Manage Ceph Services](../utility_storage/Manage_Ceph_Services.md) for Ceph troubleshooting
    steps, which may include restarting Ceph services.

    Once Ceph is healthy, repeat the `sat bootsys boot --stage platform-services` command to finish
    starting the Kubernetes cluster.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check the space available on the Ceph cluster.

    ```bash
    ceph df
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text

1. If `%USED` for any pool approaches 80% used, then resolve the space issue.

    To resolve the space issue, see [Troubleshoot Ceph OSDs Reporting Full](../utility_storage/Troubleshoot_Ceph_OSDs_Reporting_Full.md).

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Manually mount S3 filesystems on the master and worker nodes. The workers try
    to mount several S3 filesystems when they are booted, but Ceph is not available yet at that
    time, so this workaround is required. The `boot-images` S3 filesystem is required for CPS pods
    to successfully start on workers.

    ```bash
    pdsh -w ncn-m00[1-3],ncn-w00[1-3] "awk '{ if (\$3 == \"fuse.s3fs\") { print \$2; }}' /etc/fstab | xargs -I {} -n 1 sh -c \"mountpoint {} || mount {}\""
    ```

    Ensure all masters and workers are included in the host list for this `pdsh` command.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Monitor the status of the management cluster and which pods are restarting (as indicated by either a `Running` or `Completed` state).

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep -v -e Running -e Completed
    ```

    The pods and containers are normally restored in approximately 10 minutes.

    Because no containers are running, all pods first transition to an `Error` state. The error state indicates that their containers were stopped. The `kubelet` on each node
    restarts the containers for each pod. The `RESTARTS` column of the `kubectl get pods -A` command increments as each pod progresses through the restart sequence.

    If there are pods in the `MatchNodeSelector` state, delete these pods. Then verify that the pods restart and are in the `Running` state.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check the status of the `slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` pods to determine if they are starting:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod -n user -lapp=slurmctld
    kubectl describe pod -n user -lapp=slurmdbd
    ```

    An error similar to the following may be seen:

    ```text
    Events:

    sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to setup network for sandbox
    ```

    If the preceding error is displayed, then remove all files in the following directories on all worker nodes:

    * `/var/lib/cni/networks/macvlan-slurmctld-nmn-conf`
    * `/var/lib/cni/networks/macvlan-slurmdbd-nmn-conf`

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check that `spire` pods have started.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n spire -o wide | grep spire-jwks
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    spire-jwks-6b97457548-gc7td    2/3  CrashLoopBackOff   9    23h   10.44.0.117  ncn-w002 <none>   <none>
    spire-jwks-6b97457548-jd7bd    2/3  CrashLoopBackOff   9    23h   10.36.0.123  ncn-w003 <none>   <none>

    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) If Spire pods indicate `CrashLoopBackOff`, then restart the Spire deployment.

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart -n spire deployment spire-jwks
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Rejoin Kubernetes to the worker and master NCNs, to avoid issues with Spire tokens.

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart -n spire daemonset request-ncn-join-token
    kubectl rollout status -n spire daemonset request-ncn-join-token
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check if any pods are in `CrashLoopBackOff` state because of errors connecting to Vault.

    If so, restart the Vault operator, then the Vault pods, and finally the pod which is in `CrashLoopBackOff`. For example:

    1. Find the pods that are in `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -A | grep CrashLoopBackOff
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        services     cray-console-node-1        2/3     CrashLoopBackOff   206        6d21h
        ```

    1. View the logs for the pods in `CrashLoopBackOff`.

        ```bash
        kubectl -n services logs cray-console-node-1 cray-console-node | grep "connection failure" | grep vault
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        2021/08/26 16:39:28 Error: &api.ResponseError{HTTPMethod:"PUT", URL:"http://cray-vault.vault:8200/v1/auth/kubernetes/login", StatusCode:503, RawError:true, Errors:[]string{"upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection failure"}}
        panic: Error: &api.ResponseError{HTTPMethod:"PUT", URL:"http://cray-vault.vault:8200/v1/auth/kubernetes/login", StatusCode:503, RawError:true, Errors:[]string{"upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection failure"}}
        ```

    1. Restart the `vault-operator`.

        ```bash
        kubectl delete pods -n vault -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault-operator
        ```

    1. Wait for the `cray-vault` pods to restart with `5/5` ready and `Running`.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -n vault -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault-operator
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        cray-vault-operator-69b4b6887-dfn2f   2/2     Running   2          1m
        ```

    1. Restart the pods.

        In this example, `cray-console-node-1` is the only pod.

        ```bash
        kubectl delete pod cray-console-node-1 -n services
        ```

    1. Wait for the pods to restart with `3/3` ready and `Running`.

        In this example, `cray-console-node-1` is the only pod.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -n services | grep cray-console-node-1
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        cray-console-node-1      3/3     Running            0          2m
        ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Determine whether the `cfs-state-reporter` service is failing to start on each manager/master and worker NCN while trying to contact CFS.

    ```bash
    pdsh -w ncn-m00[1-3],ncn-w00[1-3] systemctl status cfs-state-reporter
    ```

    Example output:

    ```

    1. (`ncn#`) On each NCN where `cfs-state-reporter` is stuck in `activating` as shown in the preceding error messages, restart the `cfs-state-reporter` service.

        Do this by logging in to each affected NCN and running the following command:

        ```bash
        systemctl restart cfs-state-reporter
        ```

    1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check the status again.

        ```bash
        pdsh -w ncn-m00[1-3],ncn-w00[1-3] systemctl status cfs-state-reporter
        ```

### Verify BGP peering sessions

1. Check the status of the Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\).

    See [Check BGP Status and Reset Sessions](../network/metallb_bgp/Check_BGP_Status_and_Reset_Sessions.md).

1. Check the status and health of `etcd` clusters.

    See [Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters](../kubernetes/Check_the_Health_and_Balance_of_etcd_Clusters.md).

### Check `cronjobs`

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Display all the Kubernetes `cronjobs`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get cronjobs.batch -A
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAMESPACE     NAME                              SCHEDULE       SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
    kube-system   kube-etcdbackup                   */10 * * * *   False     0        2d1h            29d
    operators     kube-etcd-defrag                  0 0 * * *      False     0        18h             29d
    operators     kube-etcd-defrag-cray-hbtd-etcd   0 */4 * * *    False     0        178m            29d
    operators     kube-etcd-periodic-backup-cron    0 * * * *      False     0        58m             29d
    services      cray-dns-unbound-manager          */3 * * * *    False     0        63s             18h
    services      hms-discovery                     */3 * * * *    False     1        63s             18h
    services      hms-postgresql-pruner             */5 * * * *    False     0        3m3s            18h
    services      sonar-sync                        */1 * * * *    False     0        63s             18h
    sma           sma-pgdb-cron                     10 4 * * *     False     0        14h             27d
    ```

    **Attention:** It is normal for the `hms-discovery` service to be suspended at this point if liquid-cooled cabinets have not been powered on. The `hms-discovery` service is
    un-suspended during the liquid-cooled cabinet power on procedure. Do not recreate the `hms-discovery` `cronjob` at this point.

1. Check for `cronjobs` that have a `LAST SCHEDULE` time that is older than the `SCHEDULE` time. These `cronjobs` must be restarted.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check any `cronjobs` in question for errors.

    ```bash
    kubectl describe cronjobs.batch -n kube-system kube-etcdbackup | egrep -A 15 Events
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    Events:
      Type     Reason            Age                      From                Message
      ----     ------            ----                     ----                -------
      Warning  FailedNeedsStart  4m15s (x15156 over 42h)  cronjob-controller  Cannot determine if job needs to be \
                                                                              started: too many missed start time (> 100). \
                                                                              Set or decrease .spec.startingDeadlineSeconds \
                                                                              or check clock skew
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) For any `cronjobs` producing errors, get the YAML representation of the `cronjob` and edit the YAML file:

    ```bash
    cd ~/k8s
    CRON_JOB_NAME=name-of-k8s-cron-job
    kubectl get cronjobs.batch -n NAMESPACE "${CRON_JOB_NAME}" -o yaml > "${CRON_JOB_NAME}-cronjob.yaml"
    vi "${CRON_JOB_NAME}-cronjob.yaml"
    ```

    1. Delete all lines that contain `uid:`.

    1. Delete the entire `status:` section, including the `status` key.

    1. Save the file and quit the editor.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Delete the `cronjob`.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f "${CRON_JOB_NAME}-cronjob.yaml"
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Apply the `cronjob`.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f "${CRON_JOB_NAME}-cronjob.yaml"
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Verify that the `cronjob` has been scheduled.

    ```bash
    kubectl get cronjobs -n backups benji-k8s-backup-backups-namespace
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    NAME                                 SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
    kube-etcdbackup                      */10 * * * *  False     0        92s             29
    ```

### Check the HSM inventory status of NCNs

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Use the `sat` command to check for management NCNs in an `Off` state.

    ```bash
    sat status --filter role=management --filter enabled=true --filter=state=off \
        --fields xname,aliases,state,flag,role,subrole
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    +----------------+----------+-------+------+------------+---------+
    | xname          | Aliases  | State | Flag | Role       | SubRole |
    +----------------+----------+-------+------+------------+---------+
    | x3000c0s13b0n0 | ncn-w004 | Off   | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    | x3000c0s25b0n0 | ncn-w005 | Off   | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    +----------------+----------+-------+------+------------+---------+
    ```

    **Attention:** When the NCNs are brought back online after a power outage or planned shutdown, `sat status` may report them as being `Off`.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Run a manual discovery of any NCNs in the `Off` state.

    ```bash
    cray hsm inventory discover create --xnames x3000c0s12b0,x3000c0s20b0 --format toml
    ```

    Example output:

    ```toml
    [[results]]
    URI = "/hsm/v2/Inventory/DiscoveryStatus/0"
    ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check for NCN status.

    ```bash
    sat status --filter role=management --filter enabled=true --fields xname,aliases,state,flag,role,subrole
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    +----------------+----------+-----------+------+------------+---------+
    | xname          | Aliases  | State     | Flag | Role       | SubRole |
    +----------------+----------+-----------+------+------------+---------+
    | x3000c0s1b0n0  | ncn-m001 | Populated | OK   | Management | Master  |
    | x3000c0s3b0n0  | ncn-m002 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Master  |
    | x3000c0s5b0n0  | ncn-m003 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Master  |
    | x3000c0s7b0n0  | ncn-w001 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    | x3000c0s9b0n0  | ncn-w002 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    | x3000c0s11b0n0 | ncn-w003 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    | x3000c0s13b0n0 | ncn-w004 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    | x3000c0s17b0n0 | ncn-s001 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Storage |
    | x3000c0s19b0n0 | ncn-s002 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Storage |
    | x3000c0s21b0n0 | ncn-s003 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Storage |
    | x3000c0s25b0n0 | ncn-w005 | Ready     | OK   | Management | Worker  |
    +----------------+----------+-----------+------+------------+---------+
    ```

1. To check the health and status of the management cluster after a power cycle, refer to the sections 1-4 in [Validate CSM Health](../validate_csm_health.md).
