# Shut Down and Power Off Compute and User Access Nodes

Shut down and power off compute and user access nodes \(UANs\). This procedure powers off all compute nodes in the context of an entire system shutdown.

## Prerequisites

The `cray` and `sat` commands must be initialized and authenticated with valid credentials for Keycloak. If these have not been prepared, then see
[Configure the Cray Command Line Interface (`cray` CLI)](../configure_cray_cli.md) and refer to the "SAT Authentication" section of the *HPE Cray EX
System Admin Toolkit (SAT) (S-8031)* product stream documentation for instructions on how to acquire a SAT authentication token.

## Procedure

1. (`ncn-mw#`) List detailed information about the available boot orchestration service \(BOS\) session template names.

   Identify the BOS session template names such as `cos-2.0.x`, `uan-slurm`, and choose the appropriate compute and UAN node templates for the shutdown.

   ```bash
   cray bos v2 sessiontemplates list --format toml
   ```

   Example output excerpts:

   ```text
   [[results]]
   name = "cos-2.0.x"
   description = "BOS session template for booting compute nodes, generated by the installation"

   [...]

   name = "slurm"
   description = "BOS session template for booting compute nodes, generated by the installation"

   [...]

   name = "uan-slurm"
   description = "Template for booting UANs with Slurm"
   ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) To display more information about a session template, for example `cos-2.0.x`, use the `describe` option.

   ```bash
   cray bos v2 sessiontemplates describe cos-2.0.x
   ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Use `sat bootsys shutdown` to shut down and power off UANs and compute nodes.

   **Attention:** Specify the required session templates for `COS_SESSION_TEMPLATE` and `UAN_SESSION_TEMPLATE` in the example.

   An optional `--loglevel debug` can be used to provide more information as the system shuts down. If used, it must be added after `sat` but before `bootsys`.

   ```bash
   sat bootsys shutdown --stage bos-operations \
            --bos-templates COS_SESSION_TEMPLATE,UAN_SESSION_TEMPLATE
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   Started boot operation on BOS session templates: cos-2.0.x, uan.
   Waiting up to 600 seconds for sessions to complete.

   [...]

   All BOS sessions completed.
   ```

   **Note:** In certain cases, the command may display an error similar to the following:

   ```text
   ERROR: Failed to get state of nodes in session template 'UAN_SESSION_TEMPLATE': Failed to get state of nodes with role=['Application', 'Application_UAN'] for boot set 'BOOT_SET' of session template 'UAN_SESSION_TEMPLATE': GET request to URL 'https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/smd/hsm/v2/State/Components' failed with status code 400: Bad Request. Bad Request Detail: bad query param: Argument was not a valid HMS Role
   ```

   This is a non-fatal error and does not affect the `bos-operations` stage of `sat bootsys`.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the status of both UAN and compute nodes to verify that they are `Off`.

   There may be a delay in nodes reaching the `Off` state in the hardware state manager \(HSM\).

   ```bash
   sat status
   ```

   Example output:
