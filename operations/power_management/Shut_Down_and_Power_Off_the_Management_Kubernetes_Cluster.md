# Shut Down and Power Off the Management Kubernetes Cluster

Shut down management services and power off the HPE Cray EX management Kubernetes cluster.

**Important:** When performing a complete system shutdown, do NOT start with this page. Refer to [System Power Off Procedures](System_Power_Off_Procedures.md) for the expected shutdown sequence.

## Overview

Understand the following concepts before powering off the management non-compute nodes \(NCNs\) for the Kubernetes cluster and storage:

- The etcd cluster provides storage for the state of the management Kubernetes cluster. The three node etcd cluster runs on the same nodes that are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. The
  management cluster state must be frozen when powering off the Kubernetes cluster. When one member is unavailable, the two other members continue to provide full access to the data. When two
  members are down, the remaining member will switch to only providing read-only access to the data.
- **Avoid unnecessary data movement with Ceph**: The Ceph cluster runs not only on the dedicated storage nodes, but also on the nodes configured as Kubernetes master nodes. Specifically, the `mon`
  processes. If one of the storage nodes goes down, then Ceph can rebalance the data onto the remaining nodes and object storage daemons \(OSDs\) to regain full protection.
- **Avoid spinning up replacement pods on worker nodes**: Kubernetes keeps all pods running on the management cluster. The `kubelet` process on each node retrieves information from the etcd
  cluster about which pods must be running. If a node becomes unavailable for more than five minutes, then Kubernetes creates replacement pods on other management nodes.
- **High-Speed Network \(HSN\)**: When the management cluster is shut down the HSN is also shut down.

The `sat bootsys` command automates the shutdown of Ceph and the Kubernetes management cluster and performs these tasks:

- Stops `etcd` and which freezes the state of the Kubernetes cluster on each management node.
- Stops **and disables** the `kubelet` on each management and worker node.
- Stops all containers on each management and worker node.
- Stops `containerd` on each management and worker node.
- Stops Ceph from rebalancing on the management node that is running a `mon` process.

## Prerequisites

An authentication token is required to access the API gateway and to use the `sat` command. See the "SAT Authentication" section of the HPE Cray EX System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product stream
documentation (`S-8031`) for instructions on how to acquire a SAT authentication token.

## Check health of the management cluster

1. To check the health and status of the management cluster before shutdown, see the "Platform Health Checks" section in [Validate CSM Health](../validate_csm_health.md).

1. Check the health and backup etcd clusters:

   1. Determine which etcd clusters must be backed up and if they are healthy.

      Review [Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters](../kubernetes/Check_the_Health_and_Balance_of_etcd_Clusters.md).

   1. Backup etcd clusters.

      See [Backups for etcd-operator Clusters](../kubernetes/Backups_for_etcd-operator_Clusters.md).

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Check the status of NCN no wipe settings.

   Make sure that `metal.no-wipe=1`. If any management NCNs do not have that set, then review
   [Check and Set the `metal.no-wipe` Setting on NCNs](../node_management/Check_and_Set_the_metalno-wipe_Setting_on_NCNs.md) before proceeding.

   ```bash
   /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnGetXnames.sh
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text

   ```

## Shut down the Kubernetes management cluster

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Set variables for the three types of management NCNs as comma-separated lists.

   ```bash
   MASTERS="ncn-m002,ncn-m003"
   STORAGE=$(ceph orch host ls | grep ncn-s | awk '{print $1}' | xargs | sed 's/ /,/g')
   WORKERS=$(kubectl get nodes | grep ncn-w | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u | xargs | sed 's/ /,/g')
   ```

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Shut down platform services.

   ```bash
   sat bootsys shutdown --stage platform-services
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   The following Non-compute Nodes (NCNs) will be included in this operation:
   managers:
   - ncn-m001
   storage:
   - ncn-s001
   - ncn-s002
   - ncn-s003
   workers:
   - ncn-w001
   - ncn-w002
   - ncn-w003

   Are the above NCN groupings correct? [yes,no] yes

   Executing step: Create etcd snapshot on all Kubernetes manager NCNs.
   Executing step: Stop etcd on all Kubernetes manager NCNs.
   Executing step: Stop and disable kubelet on all Kubernetes NCNs.
   Executing step: Stop containers running under containerd on all Kubernetes NCNs.

   Aborting.
   ```

   In the preceding example, the commands to stop containers timed out on all the worker nodes and reported `WARNING` and `ERROR` messages.
   A summary of the issue displays and prompts the user to continue or stop. Respond `no` stop the shutdown. Then review the containers running on the nodes.

   ```bash
   for ncn in $(echo $WORKERS | sed 's/,/ /g'); do echo "${ncn}"; ssh "${ncn}" "crictl ps"; echo; done
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text

   ```

   Run the `sat` command again and enter `yes` at the prompt about the `etcd` snapshot not being created:

   ```bash
   sat bootsys shutdown --stage platform-services
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text

   - ncn-s003
   workers:
   - ncn-w001
   - ncn-w002
   - ncn-w003

   Are the above NCN groupings correct? [yes,no] yes

   Executing step: Create etcd snapshot on all Kubernetes manager NCNs.

   Executing step: Check health of Ceph cluster and freeze state.
   ```

   If the process continues to report errors due to `Failed to stop containers`, then iterate on the above step. Each iteration should reduce the number of containers running. If necessary,
   containers can be manually stopped using `crictl stop CONTAINER`. If containers are stopped manually, then re-run the above procedure to complete any final steps in the process.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Shut down and power off all management NCNs except `ncn-m001`.

    **Important:** The default timeout for the `sat bootsys shutdown --stage ncn-power` command is 300 seconds. If it is known that
    the nodes take longer than this amount of time for a graceful shutdown, then a different value
    can be set using `--ncn-shutdown-timeout NCN_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` with a value other than 300
    for `NCN_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`. Once this timeout has been exceeded, the node will be forcefully
    powered down.


   1. Shutdown worker nodes first by excluding master and storage nodes from the `sat bootsys shutdown --stage ncn-power` command.

      ```bash
      sat bootsys shutdown --stage ncn-power --excluded-ncns "${MASTERS},${STORAGE}" --ncn-shutdown-timeout 900
      ```

      Example output:

    ```

1. Wait until the console indicates that the node has shut down.

1. (`external#`) From a remote system that has access to the management plane, power off `ncn-m001`.

    ```bash
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H NCN-M001_BMC_HOSTNAME chassis power status
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H NCN-M001_BMC_HOSTNAME chassis power off
    ipmitool -I lanplus -U "${USERNAME}" -E -H NCN-M001_BMC_HOSTNAME chassis power status
    ```

    **CAUTION:** The modular coolant distribution unit \(MDCU\) in a liquid-cooled HPE Cray EX2000 cabinet (also referred to as a Hill or TDS cabinet) typically receives power from its management
    cabinet PDUs. If the system includes an EX2000 cabinet, then **do not power off** the management cabinet PDUs. Powering off the MDCU will cause an emergency power off \(EPO\) of the cabinet and
    may result in data loss or equipment damage.

1. (Optional) If a liquid-cooled EX2000 cabinet is not receiving MCDU power from this management cabinet, then power off the PDU circuit breakers or disconnect the PDUs from facility power and
   follow lock out/tag out procedures for the site.
