## Overview

`tapms` is the primary Kubernetes operator through which tenant creation and management is handled.
This operator interacts with several other services in the CSM software stack to provision the necessary components for a given tenant.
This document gives an overview of its functionality.

## Tenant schema

See the [Tenant Custom Resource Definition](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/cray-tapms-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/tapms.hpe.com_tenants.yaml) for the full schema. Below is a description of the required fields for a tenant:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `tenantname` | Name of the tenant. See [Tenant naming requirements](CrayHncManager.md#tenant-naming-requirements) for restrictions on tenant naming. |
| `childnamespaces` | List of namespaces that should be created for the tenant. These namespaces be created with the name specified here, prepended with the required HNC prefix. |
| `tenantresources`.`type` | Only `compute` and `application` are supported in the current release of `tapms`. |
| `tenantresources`.`hsmgrouplabel` | The name of the HSM group label for the `xnames` specified below (mutually exclusive from `hsmpartitionname`). |
| `tenantresources`.`hsmpartitionname` | The name of the HSM partition to create and assignments for the `xnames` specified below  (mutually exclusive from `hsmgrouplabel`). |
| `tenantresources`.`enforceexclusivehsmgroups` | If `true`, tenants that share this setting will not be allowed to specify the same `xname` (only appropriate if `hsmgrouplabel` is also specified). |
| `tenantresources`.`xnames` | List of compute or application component names (xnames) that this tenant is allowed to use for running jobs. |
| `tenantresources`.`forcepoweroff` | If `true`, when the xname is powered off, the `force-off` option is passed to PCS (Power Control Service) and subsequently the Redfish endpoint, instead of a graceful shutdown. |
| `tenantkms`.`enablekms` | Create a Vault transit engine for the tenant if this setting is `true`. By default, this is `false`. If enabled, the transit name and other details will be shown in the CR status.|
| `tenantkms`.`keyname` | Optional name for the transit engine key. If not provided, a default will be used and shown in the CR status. This is only used when `enablekms` is `true`.|
| `tenantkms`.`keytype` | Optional transit engine key type. If not provided, a default will be used and shown in the CR status. This is only used when `enablekms` is `true`.|

## Reconcile operations

When a tenant CR is applied, `tapms` will:

1. Create a tenant and Kubernetes namespace with the specified `name`.
   Note that when `hnc` is deployed, it will be configured with a required prefix for tenant names ensuring that namespaces not associated with multi-tenancy are not managed by `hnc`.
   The default prefix is `vcluster`, and this can be changed during the deployment of the `cray-hnc-manager` Helm chart.
1. Create namespaces specified in the `childnamespaces` with the tenant-specific prefix.
1. Add the specified `xnames` to an HSM group or partition.
1. Apply the valued specified in `hsmgrouplabel`
1. If the `enforceexclusivehsmgroups` flag is `true`, `tapms` will ensure `xnames` cannot be specified in multiple tenants (that also have the flag set to `true` for their `hsmgrouplabel`).
1. Create a Keycloak group with the name `<tenant-name>-tenant-admin` which can be assigned to users intended to be tenant administrators.
1. If the `tenantkms`.`enablekms` flag is `true`, `tapms` will create a Vault transit engine with the name `cray-tenant-<tenant-uuid>`. See the tenant schema description above (and the CRD) for more details. The created transit engine details will be available in the Tenant CR under the `status`.`tenantkms` section.
1. Power off the xname(s) that are members of the tenant.

## Tenant states

`tapms` will report one of the following states for a tenant, depending on the current state of the tenant:

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `New` | `tapms` has begun reconciliation for a newly created tenant. |
| `Deploying` | `tapms` is in the process of deploying the tenant. |
| `Deployed` | The tenant reconciliation is complete (from the perspective of `tapms`). |
| `Deleting` | `tapms` has begun deleting the tenant. |
