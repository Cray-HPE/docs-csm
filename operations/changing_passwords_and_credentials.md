# Changing Passwords and Credentials

There are many passwords and credentials used in different contexts to manage the system. These
can be changed as needed. Their initial settings are documented, so it is recommended to change 
them during or soon after a CSM software installation.

Refer to the _HPE Cray EX System Administration Guide 1.5 S-8001_ for more information about these topics.
