## `CephMgrIsAbsent` and `CephMgrIsMissingReplicas`

If the `CephMgrIsAbsent` and/or `CephMgrIsMissingReplicas` alerts fire, use the following steps to ensure the `prometheus` module has been enabled for `Ceph`. The following steps should be executed on `ncn-s001`:

```bash
ncn-s001# ceph mgr module ls | jq '.enabled_modules'
```

Example output:

```json
[
  "cephadm",
  "iostat",
  "restful"
]
```

If `prometheus` is missing from the output, enable with the following command:

```bash
ncn-s001# ceph mgr module enable prometheus
```

Confirm the module is now enabled:

```bash
ncn-s001# ceph mgr module ls | jq '.enabled_modules'
```

Example output:

```json
[
  "cephadm",
  "iostat",
  "prometheus",
  "restful"
]
```

The `CephMgrIsAbsent` and `CephMgrIsMissingReplicas` alerts should now clear in Prometheus.

## `CephNetworkPacketsDropped`

The `CephNetworkPacketsDropped` alert does not necessarily indicate there are packets being dropped on an interface on a storage node. In a future release this alert will be renamed
to be more generic. If this alert fires, inspect the IP address in the details of the alert to determine the node in question (it can be storage, master, or worker node). If the
interface in question is determined to be healthy, then this alert can be ignored.

## `CPUThrottlingHigh`

Alerts for `CPUThrottlingHigh` on `gatekeeper-audit` can be ignored. This pod is not utilized in this release.

Alerts for `CPUThrottlingHigh` on gatekeeper-controller-manager can be ignored. This has low CPU requests, and it is normal for it to spike when it is in use.

Alerts for `CPUThrottlingHigh` on CFS services such as `cfs-batcher` and `cfs-trust` can be ignored. Because CFS is idle most of the time, these services have low CPU requests, and it is normal for CFS service resource usage to spike when it is in use.

<a name="kubepodnotready"></a>

## `KubePodNotReady`

Alerts for `KubePodNotReady` on `cray-crus` may be ignored if the Slurm software has not been installed. The `cray-crus` pod interacts with Slurm to manage compute node rolling upgrades.

## `PostgresqlFollowerReplicationLagSMA`

Alerts for `PostgresqlFollowerReplicationLagSMA` on `sma-postgres-cluster` pods with `slot_name="permanent_physical_1"` can be ignored. This `slot_name` is disabled and will be removed in a future release.

<a name="highrollbackrate"></a>

## `PostgresqlHighRollbackRate`

Alerts for `PostgresqlHighRollbackRate` on `spire-postgres` and `smd-postgres` pods can be ignored. This is caused by an idle session that requires a timeout. This will be fixed in a future release.

<a name="inactiveslot"></a>

## `PostgresqlInactiveReplicationSlot`

Alerts for `PostgresqlInactiveReplicationSlot` on `sma-postgres-cluster` pods with `slot_name="permanent_physical_1"` can be ignored. This `slot_name` is disabled and will be removed in a future release.

<a name="notenoughconnections"></a>

## `PostgresqlNotEnoughConnections`

Alerts for `PostgresqlNotEnoughConnections` for `datname="foo"` and `datname="bar"` can be ignored. These databases are not used and will be removed in a future release.
