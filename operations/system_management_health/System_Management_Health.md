## System Management Health

The primary goal of the System Management Health service is to enable system administrators to assess the health of their system. Operators need to quickly and efficiently troubleshoot system issues as they occur and be confident that a lack of issues indicates the system is operating normally. This service currently runs as a Helm chart on the system's management Kubernetes cluster and monitors the health status of core system components, triggering alerts as potential issues are observed. It uses Prometheus to aggregate metrics from etcd, Kubernetes, Istio, and Ceph, all of which include support for the Prometheus API. The System Management Health service relies on the following tools:

-   Prometheus is the standard cloud-native metrics and monitoring tool, which includes Alertmanager, a tool that handles alert duplication, silences, and notifications
-   The Prometheus operator provides custom resource definitions \(CRDs\) that make it easy to operate Prometheus and Alertmanager instances, scrape metrics from service endpoints, and trigger alerts
-   Grafana supports pulling data from Prometheus, and dashboards for system components are readily available from the open source community
-   The stable/prometheus-operator Helm chart integrates the Prometheus operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, node exporters \(daemon set\), and kube-state-metrics to provide a monitoring solution for Kubernetes clusters
-   Istio supports service mesh tracing and observability using Jaeger and Kiali, respectively

The System Management Health service is intended to complement the System Monitoring Application \(SMA\) Framework, but the two are currently not integrated. The System Management Health metrics are not available using the Telemetry API. This service scrapes metrics from system components like Ceph, Kubernetes, and the hosts using node exporter, kube-state-metrics, and cadvisor. The design is flexible and supports:

-   Filtering metrics such that only those necessary to determine system health are aggregated to the top level; all metrics are currently aggregatedâ€”no filtering is implemented
-   Independent retention and persistence settings based on needs for specific services; the current default configuration retains metrics for ten days at the top level and four hours at intermediate levels
-   Component-specific tooling for more detailed visibility:
    -   Grafana dashboards for Kubernetes
    -   Grafana dashboards, Kiali, and Jaeger for Istio
    -   Grafana dashboards for Ceph
