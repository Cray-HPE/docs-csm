# Grafana Dashboards by Component

This document show the dashboards that are available for each component in Grafana.

A Grafana dashboard is a powerful open source analytical and visualization tool that consists of multiple individual panels arranged in a grid.
The panels interact with configured data sources, including the following:

- AWS CloudWatch
- Prometheus

**NOTE:** For known issues around some of the Grafana dashboards, see [Troubleshoot Grafana Dashboards](Troubleshoot_Grafana_Dashboard.md).
