## Ceph - OSD Overview Dashboard: 3 panels not found

Currently skipping cray-sysmgmt-health pie chart plugin installation for airgapped systems. If the system is non airgapped then comment out or remove plugins property in customizations.yaml.
This will be fixed in a future release.

Command to extract customizations.yaml from the site-init secret.

```bash
ncn-m001# kubectl -n loftsman get secret site-init -o jsonpath='{.data.customizations\.yaml}' | base64 -d - > customizations.yaml
```

Example for airgapped systems (please uncomment plugins property):

```bash
cray-sysmgmt-health:
          grafana:
            externalAuthority: grafana.cmn.{{ network.dns.external }}
            # Skip plugin installation for airgapped systems.
            # If the system is non airgapped then you can comment out or remove plugins property.
            plugins: ""
```

Example for non-airgapped systems (please comment out plugins property):

```bash
cray-sysmgmt-health:
          grafana:
            externalAuthority: grafana.cmn.{{ network.dns.external }}
            # Skip plugin installation for airgapped systems.
            # If the system is non airgapped then you can comment out or remove plugins property.
            # plugins: ""
```

Commands to reupload customizations.yaml file to Kubernetes so that the changes persist.

```bash
ncn-m001# kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init 
ncn-m001# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml
```
