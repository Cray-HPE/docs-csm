# Re-Sync Keycloak Users to Compute Nodes

Resubmit the `keycloak-users-localize` job and run `keycloak-group-sync.sh` and `keycloak-passwd-sync.sh` to synchronize the users and groups from Keycloak to the compute nodes.
This procedure alters the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files used on compute nodes.

Use this procedure to quickly synchronize changes made in Keycloak to the compute nodes.

## Prerequisites

The Slurm or PBS product must be installed.

## Procedure

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Resubmit the `keycloak-users-localize` job.

    The output might appear slightly different than in the example below.

    ```bash
    kubectl get job -n services -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-keycloak-users-localize -ojson | jq '.items[0]' > keycloak-users-localize-job.json

    cat keycloak-users-localize-job.json | jq 'del(.spec.selector)' | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)' | kubectl replace --force -f -
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    job.batch "keycloak-users-localize-1" deleted
    job.batch/keycloak-users-localize-1 replaced
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Watch the pod to check the status of the job.

    The pod will go through the normal Kubernetes states. It will stay in a `Running` state for a while, and then it will go to `Completed`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n services | grep keycloak-users-localize
    ```

    Expected output looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    keycloak-users-localize-1-sk2hn                                0/2     Completed   0          2m35s
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check the pod's logs.

    Replace the `KEYCLOAK_POD_NAME` value with the pod name from the previous step.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n services KEYCLOAK_POD_NAME keycloak-localize
    ```

    Expected output should contain the following line:

    ```text
    2020-07-20 18:26:15,774 - INFO    - keycloak_localize - keycloak-localize complete
    ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Synchronize the users and groups from Keycloak to the compute nodes.

    By default, the users and groups are synchronized to compute nodes daily at midnight.

    To synchronize immediately, run these scripts from the compute nodes:

    ```bash
    pdsh -w <computes> /usr/local/sbin/keycloak-group-sync.sh
    pdsh -w <computes> /usr/local/sbin/keycloak-passwd-sync.sh
    ```

    Or, reboot the compute nodes with the Boot Orchestration Service \(BOS\).

    ```bash
    cray bos session create --template-uuid BOS_TEMPLATE --operation reboot
    ```
