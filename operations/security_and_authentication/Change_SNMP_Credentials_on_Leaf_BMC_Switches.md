# Change SNMP Credentials on Leaf-BMC Switches

This procedure changes the SNMP credentials on management leaf-BMC switches in the system. All SNMP credentials need to be the same as those found in the customizations.yaml sealed secret cray_reds_credentials.

**NOTE:** This procedure will not update the default SNMP credentials used when new leaf BMC switches are added to the system. To update the default SNMP credentials for new hardware, follow the [Update Default Air-Cooled BMC and Leaf-BMC Switch SNMP Credentials](Update_Default_Air-Cooled_BMC_and_Leaf_BMC_Switch_SNMP_Credentials.md) procedure.

## Prerequisites

-   The Cray command line interface \(CLI\) tool is initialized and configured on the system.

## Procedure

There are three steps involved. The first two steps involve running the *leaf_switch_snmp_creds.sh* script. This script can be used to check for undesirable SNMP user IDs/creds, and also to set new ones. The default behavior is to check first and then set new creds. The script can be run either interactively (no env vars or command line options) or non-interactively (using env vars on the command line). The following examples use the env var method.

1.  Set environment variables containing the new SNMP credentials:
    > `read -s` is used to prevent the password from appearing in the command history.

    1.  Set the SNMP auth password environment variable:
        ```bash
        ncn-m001# read -s SNMP_AUTH_PASS 
        ncn-m001# echo $SNMP_AUTH_PASS
        ```

        Expected output:
        ```
        foobar01
        ```

    2.  Set the SNMP priv password environment variable:
        ```bash
        ncn-m001# read -s SNMP_PRIV_PASS
        ncn-m001# echo $SNMP_PRIV_PASS
        ```

        Expected output:
        ```
        foobar02
        ```

2. Set environment variable containing the admin switch password for the management switches in the system:
    ```bash
    ncn-m001# read -s SWITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ncn-m001# echo $SWITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    secret
    ```

3. Update SNMP credentials (desired SNMP userID and auth/priv passwords) on leaf-BMC switches. The SNMP user IDs and passwords are not shown.

   Also note that this will change the SNMP credentials in Vault. See below for details on how to do that.

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# SNMPDELUSER=testuser SNMPNEWUSER=testuser \
             SNMPAUTHPW=$SNMP_AUTH_PASS SNMPPRIVPW=$SNMP_PRIV_PASS \
             SNMPMGMTPW=$SWITCH_ADMIN_PASSWORD \
             /opt/cray/csm/scripts/hms_verification/leaf_switch_snmp_creds.sh
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   ==> Getting management network leaf switch info from SLS...

   ==> Fetching switch hostnames...
   ===============================
   Checking SNMP default creds on Dell leaf switch: sw-leaf-002

   ==> SNMP user ID 'testuser' found on switch sw-leaf-002.
   Setting SNMP default creds on Aruba leaf switch: sw-leaf-002
   ===============================
   Checking SNMP default creds on Dell leaf switch: sw-leaf-001

   ==> SNMP user ID 'testuser' found on switch sw-leaf-001.
   Setting SNMP default creds on Dell leaf switch: sw-leaf-002

   ```

4.  Update Vault with new SNMP credentials:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r '.data["vault-root"]' |  base64 -d)
    ncn-m001# alias vault='kubectl -n vault exec -i cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_PASSWD VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_FORMAT=json vault'
    ```

    Either update the credentials in Vault for a single leaf switch or update Vault for all leaf switches to have same global default value:
    -   To update Vault for all leaf switches in the system to the same password:

        ```bash
        for XNAME in $(cray sls search hardware list --type comptype_mgmt_switch --format json | jq -r .[].Xname); do
            echo "Updating SNMP creds for $XNAME"
            vault kv get secret/hms-creds/$XNAME |
                jq --arg SNMP_AUTH_PASS "$SNMP_AUTH_PASS" --arg SNMP_PRIV_PASS "$SNMP_PRIV_PASS" \
                    '.data | .SNMPAuthPass=$SNMP_AUTH_PASS | .SNMPPrivPass=$SNMP_PRIV_PASS' |
                vault kv put secret/hms-creds/$XNAME -
        done
        ```
    
    -   To update Vault for a single leaf switch:

        ```bash
        ncn-m001# XNAME=x3000c0w22
        ncn-m001# vault kv get secret/hms-creds/$XNAME |
            jq --arg SNMP_AUTH_PASS "$SNMP_AUTH_PASS" --arg SNMP_PRIV_PASS "$SNMP_PRIV_PASS" \
                '.data | .SNMPAuthPass=$SNMP_AUTH_PASS | .SNMPPrivPass=$SNMP_PRIV_PASS' |
            vault kv put secret/hms-creds/$XNAME -
        ```

   

5.  Restart the River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) to pickup the new SNMP credentials:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-reds
    ncn-m001# kubectl -n services rollout status deployment cray-reds
    ```

6.  Wait for REDS to initialize itself:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# sleep 2m
    ```

7.  Verify REDS was able to communicate with the leaf-BMC switches with the updated credentials:

    Determine the name of the REDS pods:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# kubectl -n services get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cray-reds
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cray-reds-6b99b9d5dc-c5g2t   2/2     Running   0          3m21s
    ```

    Check the logs of the REDS pod for SNMP communication issues. Replace `CRAY_REDS_POD_NAME` with the currently running pod for REDS:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# kubectl -n services logs CRAY_REDS_POD_NAME cray-reds | grep "Failed to get ifIndex<->name map"
    ```

    If nothing is returned, then REDS is able to successfully communicate to the leaf-BMC switches in the system via SNMP.

    Errors like the following occur when SNMP credentials in Vault to not match what is configured on the leaf-BMC switch.

    ```
    2021/10/26 20:03:21 WARNING: Failed to get ifIndex<->name map (1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1) for x3000c0w22: Received a report from the agent - UsmStatsWrongDigests(1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.5.0)
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If the creds are not working, check the Vault creds as shown above.

If the *leaf_switch_snmp_creds.sh* script fails for whatever reason on any
leaf-BMC switch, the creds can be looked at and changed manually using the
procedures found in [Aruba SNMP Users Guide](../../operations/network/management_network/aruba/snmpv3_users.md) or [Dell SNMP Users Guide](../../operations/network/management_network/dell/snmpv3_users.md).
