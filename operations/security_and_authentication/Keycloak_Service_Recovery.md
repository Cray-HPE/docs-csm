# Keycloak Service Recovery

The following covers redeploying the Keycloak service and restoring the data.

## Prerequisites

- The system is fully installed and has transitioned off of the LiveCD.
- All activities required for site maintenance are complete.
- A backup or export of the data already exists.
- The latest CSM documentation has been installed on the master nodes. See [Check for Latest Documentation](../../update_product_stream/index.md#check-for-latest-documentation).
- The Cray CLI is configured on the node where the procedure is being performed. See [Configure the Cray CLI](../configure_cray_cli.md).

## Service recovery for Keycloak

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Verify that a backup of the Keycloak Postgres data exists.

   1. Set and export the `CRAY_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

      This will permit simple CLI operations that are needed for the command in the next step.
      See [Authenticate an Account with the Command Line](Authenticate_an_Account_with_the_Command_Line.md).

   1. Verify that a completed backup exists.

      ```bash
      cray artifacts list postgres-backup --format json | jq -r '.artifacts[].Key | select(contains("keycloak"))'
      ```

      Example output:

      ```text
      keycloak-postgres-2022-09-14T02:10:05.manifest
      keycloak-postgres-2022-09-14T02:10:05.psql
      ```

   1. Unset the `CRAY_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and remove the temporary token file.

      ```bash
      unset CRAY_CREDENTIALS
      rm -v /tmp/setup-token.json
      ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Uninstall the chart and wait for the resources to terminate.

   1. Uninstall the chart.

      ```bash
      helm uninstall -n services cray-keycloak
      ```

      Example output:

      ```text
      release "cray-keycloak" uninstalled
      ```

   1. Wait for the resources to terminate.

      ```bash
      watch "kubectl get pods -n services | grep keycloak | grep -v 'keycloak-users-localize\|keycloak-vcs-user'"
      ```

     Example output:

      ```text
      No resources found in services namespace.
      ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Redeploy the chart and wait for the resources to start.

    Follow the [Redeploying a Chart](../CSM_product_management/Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure **with the following specifications**:

    - Chart name: `cray-keycloak`
    - Base manifest name: `platform`
    - When reaching the step to update customizations, no edits need to be made to the customizations file.
    - When reaching the step to validate that the redeploy was successful, perform the following step:

        **Only follow this step as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

        Wait for the resources to start.

        ```bash
        watch "kubectl get pods -n services | grep keycloak"
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        cray-keycloak-0                                                   2/2     Running     0          32m
        cray-keycloak-1                                                   2/2     Running     0          32m
        cray-keycloak-2                                                   2/2     Running     0          32m
        keycloak-postgres-0                                               3/3     Running     0          32m
        keycloak-postgres-1                                               3/3     Running     0          31m
        keycloak-postgres-2                                               3/3     Running     0          30m
        keycloak-setup-1-9kdl2                                            0/2     Completed   0          32m
        keycloak-users-localize-1-jjb9b                                   2/2     Running     0          32m
        keycloak-vcs-user-1-gqftw                                         0/2     Completed   0          31m
        keycloak-wait-for-postgres-1-xt4nv                                0/2     Completed   0          32m
        ```

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Restore the critical data.

   See [Restore Postgres for Keycloak](../kubernetes/Restore_Postgres.md#restore-postgres-for-keycloak).
