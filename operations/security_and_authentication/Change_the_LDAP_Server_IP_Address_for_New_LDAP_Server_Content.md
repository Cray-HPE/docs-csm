## Change the LDAP Server IP Address for New LDAP Server Content

Delete the old LDAP user federation and create a new one. This procedure should only be done if the LDAP server is being replaced by a different LDAP server that has different contents.

Refer to [Change the LDAP Server IP Address for Existing LDAP Server Content](Change_the_LDAP_Server_IP_Address_for_Existing_LDAP_Server_Content.md) if the new LDAP server content matches the previous LDAP server content.

### Prerequisites
