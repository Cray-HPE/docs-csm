# Troubleshoot Booting Nodes with Hardware Issues

This document explains how to identify a node with hardware issues.

If a node included in a BOS session template is having hardware issues, then it can prevent the node from powering back up correctly.
The entire BOS session will fail with a timeout error waiting for the node to become ready.

The following example shows log output from a node with hardware issues, resulting in a failed BOS session:

```bash
ncn-mw# kubectl logs -n services BOS_POD_ID
```

Example output excerpt:

```text
2020-10-03 17:47:30,053 - ERROR   - cray.boa.smd.wait_for_nodes - Number of retries: 361 exceeded allowed amount: 360; 2 nodes were not in the state: Ready
2020-10-03 17:47:30,054 - DEBUG   - cray.boa.smd.wait_for_nodes - These nodes were not in the state: Ready
x1003c0s1b1n1
x1001c0s2b1n1
```

Disabling nodes that have underlying hardware issues preventing them from booting will help resolve this issue. This can be done using the
[Hardware State Manager (HSM)](../../glossary.md#hardware-state-manager-hsm).
This method does not return the node with hardware issues to a healthy state, but it does enable a BOS session that was encountering issues to complete successfully.
For more information, see [Disable Nodes](../node_management/Disable_Nodes.md).
