## Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Node Console or Logs Indicate that the Server Response has Timed Out

If the TFTP request is able to access the TFTP service pod but is unable to find its way back to the node, it may be because the kernel is not tracking established TFTP connections.

### Symptoms

The following image, which is tcpdump data from within the TFTP pod, shows what happens when the TFTP request cannot find a route back to the node that sent the request. The node IP address is `10.32.0.1`, which is the IP address of the Kubernetes weave network. It is forwarding the nodeâ€™s TFTP to this pod. The server IP address is `10.32.0.13`.

![](../../img/operations/TFTP_without_a_Route_Back_to_the_Node.png "TFTP Without a Route Back to the Node")

1.  Line 1: The read request from the node arrives.
2.  Line 2: The TFTP server attempts to acknowledge the read request.
3.  Line 3: ICMP complains about an unreachable destination/port.
4.  Lines 4-6: The TFTP server cannot locate the route to the node. It issues an ARP request for 10.32.0.1, but that does not have any effect.
5.  Lines 8 and 11: After waiting, the client resends a read request and eventually times out. This repeated request causes a repeat of lines 2-6 as seen in lines 9,12, and 14-17.

### Problem Detection

Check if the `nf_nat_tftp` kernel module has been loaded. The kernel module is loaded on all ingress points in the Kubernetes cluster, so there will likely be no missing kernel modules.

### Resolution

Load `nf_nat_tftp` if it has not been loaded already by executing modprobe nf\_nat\_tftp from the non-compute node \(NCN\), and then restarting the `cray-tftp` service.

```bash
ncn-m001# kubectl get pods -n services -o wide|grep -E "NAME|tftp"
NAME                         READY     STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE  IP             NODE     NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

ncn-m001# kubectl delete pod cray-tftp-885cc65c4-fk8bm
pod "cray-tftp-885cc65c4-fk8bm" deleted
