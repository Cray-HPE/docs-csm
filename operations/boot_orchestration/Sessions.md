# BOS Sessions

Overview of Boot Orchestration Service \(BOS\) session operations and limitations.

BOS creates a session when it is asked to perform one of the following operations:

* Boot - Boot a designated collection of nodes.
* Shutdown - Shutdown a designated collection of nodes.
* Reboot - Reboot a designated collection of nodes.
* Configure - Configure a designated collection of booted nodes.

BOS sessions can be used to boot compute nodes with customized image roots.

A session requires two parameters, a session template ID and an operation to perform on that template.
The BOS API's `session` endpoint can display a list of all of the sessions that have been created, including previous and currently running sessions.
The endpoint can also display the details of a given session when the specific session ID is provided as a parameter. Sessions can also be deleted through the API.

BOS supports a RESTful API. This API can be interacted with directly using tools like cURL.
It can also be interacted with through the Cray Command Line Interface \(CLI\). See [Manage a BOS Session](Manage_a_BOS_Session.md) for more information.

## Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) Functionality

The Boot Orchestration Agent \(BOA\) implements each session and sees it through to completion. A BOA is a Kubernetes job. It runs once to completion.
If there are transient failures, BOA will exit and Kubernetes will reschedule it so that it can re-execute its session.

BOA moves nodes towards the requested state, but if a node fails during any of the immediate steps, it takes note of it.
BOA will then provide a command in the output of the BOA log that can be used to retry the action.
This behavior impacts all BOS operations.

For example, if there is a 6,000 node system and 3 nodes fail to power off during a BOS operation.
BOA will continue and attempt to re-provision the remaining 5,997 nodes.
After the command is finished, it will provide output information about what the administrator needs to do to retry the last 3 nodes that failed.

## Current BOS Session Limitations

The following limitations currently exist with BOS sessions:

* No checking is done to prevent the launch of multiple sessions with overlapping lists of nodes.
  Concurrently running sessions may conflict with each other.
* The boot ordinal and shutdown ordinal are not honored.
* The partition parameter is not honored.
* The Configuration Framework Service \(CFS\) has its own limitations.
  Refer to the [Configuration Management](../configuration_management/Configuration_Management.md) documentation for more information.
