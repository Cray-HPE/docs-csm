# Post-Install Customizations

Post-install customizations may be needed as systems scale.
These customizations also need to persist across future installs or upgrades.
Not all resources can be customized post-install; common scenarios are documented in the following sections.

The following is a guide for determining where issues may exist, how to adjust the resources, and how to ensure the changes will persist.
Different values may be be needed for systems as they scale.

* [`kubectl` events `OOMKilled`](#kubectl-events-oomkilled)
* [Prometheus `CPUThrottlingHigh` alerts](#prometheus-cputhrottlinghigh-alerts)

## System domain name

The `SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME` value found in some of the URLs on this page is expected to be the system's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

(`ncn-mw#`) The FQDN can be found by running the following command on any Kubernetes NCN.

```bash
kubectl get secret site-init -n loftsman -o jsonpath='{.data.customizations\.yaml}' | base64 -d | yq r - spec.network.dns.external
```

Example output:

```text
system.hpc.amslabs.hpecorp.net
```

Be sure to modify the example URLs on this page by replacing `SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME` with the actual value found using the above command.

## `kubectl` events `OOMKilled`

Check to see if there are any recent out of memory events.

1. (`ncn-mw#`) Check `kubectl` events to see if there are any recent out of memory events.

    ```bash
    kubectl get event -A | grep OOM
    ```

1. Log in to Grafana at the following URL: `https://grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/`

1. Search for the "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod" dashboard to view the memory utilization graphs over time for any pod that has been `OOMKilled`.

## Prometheus `CPUThrottlingHigh` alerts

Check Prometheus for recent `CPUThrottlingHigh` alerts.

1. Log in to Prometheus at the following URL: `https://prometheus.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/`

   1. Select the **Alert** tab.

   1. Scroll down to the alert for `CPUThrottlingHigh`.

1. Log in to Grafana at the following URL: `https://grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/`

   1. Search for the "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod" dashboard to view the throttling graphs over time for any pod that is alerting.

## Grafana "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod" dashboard

Use Grafana to investigate and analyze CPU throttling and memory usage.

1. Log in to Grafana at the following URL: `https://grafana.cmn.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/`

1. Search for the "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod" dashboard.

1. Select the `datasource`, `namespace`, and `pod` based on the pod being examined.

   For example:

   ```yaml
   datasource: default
   namespace: sysmgmt-health
   pod: prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0
   ```

### CPU throttling

1. Select the **CPU Throttling** drop-down to see the CPU Throttling graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right).

1. Select the container (from the legends under the x axis).

1. Review the graph and adjust the `resources.limits.cpu` value as needed.

   The presence of CPU throttling does not always indicate a problem, but if a service is being slow or experiencing latency
   issues, adjusting `resources.limits.cpu` may be beneficial.

   For example:

   * If the pod is being throttled at or near 100% for any period of time, then adjustments are likely needed.
   * If the service's response time is critical, then adjusting the pod's resources to greatly reduce or eliminate any CPU throttling may be required.

   > **NOTE:** The `resources.requests.cpu` values are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to decide which node to place the pod on and do not impact CPU
   > throttling. The value of `resources.limits.cpu` can never be lower than the value of `resources.requests.cpu`.

### Memory usage

1. Select the **Memory Usage** drop-down to see the memory usage graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right).

1. Select the container (from the legends under the x axis).

1. Determine the steady state memory usage by looking at the memory usage graph for the container.

   This is where the `resources.requests.memory` value should be minimally set.
   But more importantly, determine the spike usage for the container and set the `resources.limits.memory` value based on the spike values with some additional headroom.

### Prerequisites

Most of these procedures instruct the administrator to perform the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md)
procedure for a specific chart. In these cases, the section on this page provides the administrator with the
information necessary in order to carry out that procedure. It is recommended to keep both pages open
in different browser windows for easy reference.

### Prometheus pod is `OOMKilled` or CPU throttled

Update resources associated with Prometheus in the `sysmgmt-health` namespace.
This example is based on what was needed for a system with 4000 compute nodes.
Trial and error may be needed to determine what is best for a given system at scale.

Follow the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure **with the following specifications**:

* Chart name: `cray-sysmgmt-health`
* Base manifest name: `platform`
* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to update the customizations, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Edit the customizations by adding or updating `spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources`.

        * If the number of NCNs is less than 20, then:

            ```bash
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.requests.cpu' --style=double '2'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.requests.memory' '15Gi'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.limits.cpu' --style=double '6'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.limits.memory' '30Gi'
            ```

        * If the number of NCNs is 20 or more, then:

            ```bash
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.requests.cpu' --style=double '6'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.requests.memory' '50Gi'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.limits.cpu' --style=double '12'
            yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources.limits.memory' '60Gi'
            ```

    1. Check that the customization file has been updated.

        ```bash
        yq read customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-sysmgmt-health.prometheus-operator.prometheus.prometheusSpec.resources'
        ```

        Example output:

        ```yaml
        requests:
          cpu: "3"
          memory: 15Gi
        limits:
          cpu: "6"
          memory: 30Gi
        ```

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to validate the redeployed chart, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    Verify that the pod restarts and that the desired resources have been applied.

    1. Watch the `prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0` pod restart.

        ```bash
        watch "kubectl get pods -n sysmgmt-health -l prometheus=cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus"
        ```

        It may take about 10 minutes for the `prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0` pod to terminate.
        It can be forced deleted if it remains in the terminating state:

        ```bash
        kubectl delete pod prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0 --force --grace-period=0 -n sysmgmt-health
        ```

    1. Verify that the resource changes are in place.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pod prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0 -n sysmgmt-health -o json | jq -r '.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "prometheus").resources'
        ```

* **Make sure to perform the entire linked procedure, including the step to save the updated customizations.**

### Postgres pods are `OOMKilled` or CPU throttled

Update resources associated with `spire-postgres` in the `spire` namespace.
This example is based on what was needed for a system with 4000 compute nodes.
Trial and error may be needed to determine what is best for a given system at scale.

A similar flow can be used to update the resources for `cray-sls-postgres`, `cray-smd-postgres`, or `gitea-vcs-postgres`.

The following table provides values the administrator will need based on which pods are
experiencing problems.

| Chart name           | Base manifest name   | Resource path name | Kubernetes namespace |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `cray-sls-postgres`  | `core-services`      | `cray-hms-sls`     | `services`           |
| `cray-smd-postgres`  | `core-services`      | `cray-hms-smd`     | `services`           |
| `gitea-vcs-postgres` | `sysmgmt`            | `gitea`            | `services`           |
| `spire-postgres`     | `sysmgmt`            | `spire`            | `spire`              |

Using the values from the above table, follow the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) **with the following specifications**:

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to update the customizations, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Set the `rpname` variable to the appropriate resource path name from the table above.

        ```bash
        rpname=<put resource path name from table here>
        ```

    1. Edit the customizations by adding or updating `spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources`.

        ```bash
        yq write -i customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources.requests.cpu" --style=double '4'
        yq write -i customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources.requests.memory" '4Gi'
        yq write -i customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources.limits.cpu" --style=double '8'
        yq write -i customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources.limits.memory" '8Gi'
        ```

    1. Check that the customization file has been updated.

        ```bash
        yq read customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.resources"
        ```

        Example output:

        ```yaml
        requests:
          cpu: "4"
          memory: 4Gi
        limits:
          cpu: "8"
          memory: 8Gi
        ```

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to validate the redeployed chart, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    Verify that the pods restart and that the desired resources have been applied. Commands in this section  use the
    `$CHART_NAME` variable which should have been set as part of the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure.

    1. Set the `ns` variable to the name of the appropriate Kubernetes namespace from the earlier table.

        ```bash
        ns=<put kubernetes namespace here>
        ```

    1. Watch the pod restart.

        ```bash
        watch "kubectl get pods -n ${ns} -l application=spilo,cluster-name=${CHART_NAME}"
        ```

    1. Verify that the desired resources have been applied.

        ```bash
        kubectl get pod ${CHART_NAME}-0 -n "${ns}" -o json | jq -r '.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "postgres").resources'
        ```

        Example output:

        ```json
        {
        "limits": {
           "cpu": "8",
           "memory": "8Gi"
        },
        "requests": {
           "cpu": "4",
           "memory": "4Gi"
        }
        }
        ```

* **Make sure to perform the entire linked procedure, including the step to save the updated customizations.**

### Scale `cray-bss` service

Scale the replica count associated with the `cray-bss` service in the `services` namespace.
This example is based on what was needed for a system with 4000 compute nodes.
Trial and error may be needed to determine what is best for a given system at scale.

Follow the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure **with the following specifications**:

* Chart name: `cray-hms-bss`
* Base manifest name: `sysmgmt`
* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to update the customizations, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Edit the customizations by adding or updating `spec.kubernetes.services.cray-hms-bss.cray-service.replicaCount`.

        ```bash
        yq write -i customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-hms-bss.cray-service.replicaCount' '5'
        ```

    1. Check that the customization file has been updated.

        ```bash
        yq read customizations.yaml 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-hms-bss.cray-service.replicaCount'
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        5
        ```

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to validate the redeployed chart, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    Verify the `cray-bss` pods scale.

    1. Watch the `cray-bss` pods scale to the desired number (in this example, 5), with each pod reaching a `2/2` ready state.

        ```bash
        watch "kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cray-hms-bss -n services"
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        cray-bss-fccbc9f7d-7jw2q   2/2     Running   0          82m
        cray-bss-fccbc9f7d-l524g   2/2     Running   0          93s
        cray-bss-fccbc9f7d-qwzst   2/2     Running   0          93s
        cray-bss-fccbc9f7d-sw48b   2/2     Running   0          82m
        cray-bss-fccbc9f7d-xr26l   2/2     Running   0          82m
        ```

    1. Verify that the replicas change is present in the Kubernetes `cray-bss` deployment.

        ```bash
        kubectl get deployment cray-bss -n services -o json | jq -r '.spec.replicas'
        ```

        In this example, `5` will be the returned value.

* **Make sure to perform the entire linked procedure, including the step to save the updated customizations.**

### Postgres PVC resize

Increase the PVC volume size associated with `cray-smd-postgres` cluster in the `services` namespace.
This example is based on what was needed for a system with 4000 compute nodes.
Trial and error may be needed to determine what is best for a given system at scale. The PVC size can only ever be increased.

A similar flow can be used to update the resources for `cray-sls-postgres`, `gitea-vcs-postgres`, or `spire-postgres`.

The following table provides values the administrator will need based on which pods are
experiencing problems.

| Chart name           | Base manifest name   | Resource path name | Kubernetes namespace |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `cray-sls-postgres`  | `core-services`      | `cray-hms-sls`     | `services`           |
| `cray-smd-postgres`  | `core-services`      | `cray-hms-smd`     | `services`           |
| `gitea-vcs-postgres` | `sysmgmt`            | `gitea`            | `services`           |
| `spire-postgres`     | `sysmgmt`            | `spire`            | `spire`              |

Using the values from the above table, follow the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) **with the following specifications**:

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to update the customizations, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Set the `rpname` variable to the appropriate resource path name from the table above.

        ```bash
        rpname=<put resource path name from table here>
        ```

    1. Edit the customizations by adding or updating `spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.volumeSize`.

        ```bash
        yq write -i customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.volumeSize" '100Gi'
        ```

    1. Check that the customization file has been updated.

        ```bash
        yq read customizations.yaml "spec.kubernetes.services.${rpname}.cray-service.sqlCluster.volumeSize"
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        100Gi
        ```

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to validate the redeployed chart, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    Verify that the pods restart and that the desired resources have been applied. Commands in this section  use the
    `$CHART_NAME` variable which should have been set as part of the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure.

    1. Set the `ns` variable to the name of the appropriate Kubernetes namespace from the earlier table.

        ```bash
        ns=<put kubernetes namespace here>
        ```

    1. Verify that the increased volume size has been applied.

        ```bash
        watch "kubectl get postgresql ${CHART_NAME} -n $ns"
        ```

        Example output:

        ```text
        NAME                TEAM       VERSION   PODS   VOLUME   CPU-REQUEST   MEMORY-REQUEST   AGE   STATUS
        cray-smd-postgres   cray-smd   11        3      100Gi     500m          8Gi              45m  Running
        ```

    1. If the status on the above command is `SyncFailed` instead of `Running`, refer to *Case 1* in the
       `SyncFailed` section of [Troubleshoot Postgres Database](../kubernetes/Troubleshoot_Postgres_Database.md#postgres-status-syncfailed).

        At this point the Postgres cluster is healthy, but additional steps are required to complete the resize of the Postgres PVCs.

* **Make sure to perform the entire linked procedure, including the step to save the updated customizations.**

### `cray-hms-hmcollector` pods are `OOMKilled`

Update resources associated with `cray-hms-hmcollector` in the `services` namespace.
Trial and error may be needed to determine what is best for a given system at scale.
See [Adjust HM Collector Ingress Replicas and Resource Limits](../hmcollector/adjust_hmcollector_resource_limits_requests.md).

### `cray-cfs-api` pods are `OOMKilled`

Increase the memory requests and limits associated with the `cray-cfs-api` deployment in the `services` namespace.

Follow the [Redeploying a Chart](Redeploying_a_Chart.md) procedure **with the following specifications**:

* Chart name: `cray-cfs-api`
* Base manifest name: `sysmgmt`
* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to update the customizations, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Edit the customizations by adding or updating `spec.kubernetes.services.cray-cfs-api.cray-service.containers.cray-cfs-api.resources`.

        ```bash
        yq4 -i '.spec.kubernetes.services.cray-cfs-api.cray-service.containers.cray-cfs-api.resources.requests.memory="200Mi"' customizations.yaml
        yq4 -i '.spec.kubernetes.services.cray-cfs-api.cray-service.containers.cray-cfs-api.resources.limits.memory="500Mi"' customizations.yaml
        ```

    1. Check that the customization file has been updated.

        * Check the memory request value.

            ```bash
            yq4 '.spec.kubernetes.services.cray-cfs-api.cray-service.containers.cray-cfs-api.resources.requests.memory' customizations.yaml
            ```

            Expected output:

            ```text
            200Mi
            ```

        * Check the memory limit value.

            ```bash
            yq4 '.spec.kubernetes.services.cray-cfs-api.cray-service.containers.cray-cfs-api.resources.limits.memory' customizations.yaml
            ```

            Expected output:

            ```text
            500Mi
            ```

* (`ncn-mw#`) When reaching the step to validate the redeployed chart, perform the following steps:

    **Only follow these steps as part of the previously linked chart redeploy procedure.**

    1. Verify that the increased memory request and limit have been applied.

        ```bash
        kubectl get deployment -n services cray-cfs-api -o json | jq .spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources
        ```

        Example output:

        ```json
        {
          "limits": {
            "cpu": "500m",
            "memory": "500Mi"
          },
          "requests": {
            "cpu": "150m",
            "memory": "200Mi"
          }
        }
        ```

    1. Run a CFS health check.

        ```bash
        /usr/local/bin/cmsdev test -q cfs
        ```

        For more details on this test, including known issues and other command line options, see [Software Management Services health checks](../../troubleshooting/known_issues/sms_health_check.md).

* **Make sure to perform the entire linked procedure, including the step to save the updated customizations.**
