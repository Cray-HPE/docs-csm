# Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode

**NOTE:** UAI is deprecated in CSM 1.5.2 and will be removed in CSM 1.6.

Each UAI broker will create and manage a single class of End-User UAIs. A site using the Broker Mode of UAI management must create a Brokered End-User UAI Class for each distinct type of End-User UAI it wants served by a Broker UAI.
Information on what should be configured for a Brokered End-User UAI Class can be found in [UAI Classes](UAI_Classes.md).
