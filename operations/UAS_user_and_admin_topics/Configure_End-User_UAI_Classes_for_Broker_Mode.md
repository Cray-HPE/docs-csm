## Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode

Each UAI broker will create and manage a single class of End-User UAIs.  A site using the Broker Mode of UAI management must create a Brokered End-User UAI Class for each distinct type of End-User UAI it wants served by a Broker UAI.  Information on what should be configured for a Brokered End-User UAI Class can be found in [UAI Classes](UAI_Classes.md).
