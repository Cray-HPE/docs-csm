# Special Purpose UAIs

UAIs are not only for interactive user logins. UAI classes enable HPE Cray EX administrators to build and deploy UAIs that server special functions, like the prebuilt broker UAI.

Most UAIs are end-user UAIs. UAI classes, however, make it possible to construct UAIs which serve special purposes that are not strictly end user oriented. One example is the broker UAI which provides on-demand end-user UAI launch and management. While no other specialty UAI types currently exist, users are encouraged to innovate as needed.
