* The administrator must have the HPE Cray EX System CLI (`cray` command) installed on the above host
* The HPE Cray EX System CLI must be configured (initialized - `cray init` command) to reach the HPE Cray EX System API Gateway

```
For example:

```bash
ncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais describe uai-broker-07624d65
uai_age = "5h33m"
uai_connect_string = "ssh broker@34.136.140.107"
uai_host = "ncn-w003"
uai_img = "registry.local/cray/cray-uai-broker:1.2.4"
uai_ip = "34.136.140.107"
uai_msg = ""
uai_name = "uai-broker-07624d65"
