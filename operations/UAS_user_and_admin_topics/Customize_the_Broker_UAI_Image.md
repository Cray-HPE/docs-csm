## Customize the Broker UAI Image

The Broker UAI image that comes with UAS is the image used to construct Broker UAIs.

The key pieces of the Broker UAI image are:

* An entrypoint shell script that initializes the container and starts the SSH daemon running.
* An SSH configuration that forces logged in users into the `switchboard` command which creates / selects End-User UAIs and redirects connections.

The primary way to customize the Broker UAI image is by [defining volumes and connecting them to the Broker UAI class](Configure_a_Broker_UAI_Class.md) for a given broker. Some customizations may require action that cannot be covered simply by using volumes to override configuration. Those cases generally require changing the Broker UAI behavior in some way. Those cases can be covered either by volume mounting a customized entrypoint script, or volume mounting a customized SSH configuration. Both of these cases are shown in the following examples.

### Customize the Broker UAI Entrypoint Script

The Broker UAI entrypoint script runs once every time the Broker UAI starts. It resides at `/app/broker/entrypoint.sh` in the Broker UAI image. The entrypoint script is the only file in that directory, so it can be overridden by creating a Kubernetes ConfigMap in the `uas` namespace containing the modified script and creating a volume using that ConfigMap with a mount point of `/app/broker`. There is critical content in the entrypoint script that should not be modified.

The following shows the contents of an unmodified script:

echo "Configure PAM to use sssd..."
pam-config -a --sss --mkhomedir

echo "Generating broker host keys..."
ssh-keygen -A

echo "Checking for UAI_CREATION_CLASS..."
if ! [ -z $UAI_CREATION_CLASS ]; then
    echo UAI_CREATION_CLASS=$UAI_CREATION_CLASS >> /etc/environment
fi

echo "Starting sshd..."
/usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/switchboard/sshd_config

echo "Starting sssd..."
sssd

sleep infinity
```

Starting at the top:

* `pam_config ...` can be customized to set up PAM as needed. The configuration here assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server for authentication and that, if a home directory is not present for a user at login, one should be made on the broker.
* The `ssh-keygen...` part is needed to set up the SSH host key for the broker and should be left alone.
* The `UAI_CREATION_CLASS` code should be left alone, as it sets up information used by `switchboard` to create End-User UAIs.
* The `/usr/sbin/sshd...` part starts the SSH server on the broker and should be left alone. Configuration of SSH is covered in the next section and is done by replacing `/etc/switchboard/sshd_config` not by modifying this line.
* The `sssd` part assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server, it can be changed as needed.
* The `sleep infinity` prevents the script from exiting which keeps the Broker UAI running. It should not be removed or altered.

As long as the basic flow and contents described here are honored, other changes to this script should work without compromising the Broker UAI's function.

The following is an example of replacing the entrypoint script with a new entrypoint script that changes the SSSD invocation to explicitly specify the `sssd.conf` file path (the standard path is used here, but a different path might make customizing SSSD for a given site simpler under some set of circumstances):

With the Broker UAI class updated, all that remains is to clear out any existing End-User UAIs (existing UAIs will not work with the new broker because the new broker will have a new key-pair shared with its UAIs) and the existing Broker UAI (if any) and create a new Broker UAI.

**NOTE:** Clearing out existing UAIs will terminate any user activity on those UAIs, make sure that users are warned of the disruption.

### Customize the Broker UAI SSH Configuration

The SSH configuration used on Broker UAIs resides in `/etc/switchboard/sshd_config` and contains the following:

```
Port 30123
AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server
AcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES
AcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT
AcceptEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL
AcceptEnv UAI_ONE_SHOT
UseDNS no

Match User !root,*
	PermitTTY yes
	ForceCommand /usr/bin/switchboard broker --class-id $UAI_CREATION_CLASS
```
The important content here is as follows:

* `Port 30123` tells sshd to listen on a port that can be reached through port forwarding by the publicly visible Kubernetes service.
* The `UseDNS no` avoids any DNS issues resulting from the Broker UAI running in the Kubernetes network space.
* The `permitTTY yes` setting permits interactive UAI logins.
* The `ForceCommand ...` statement ensures that users are always sent on to End-User UAIs or drop out of the Broker UAI on failure, preventing users from directly accessing the Broker UAI.
* The `AcceptEnv UAI_ONE_SHOT` setting is not required, but it allows a user to set the UAI_ONE_SHOT variable which instructs the broker to delete any created End-User UAI after the user logs out.

These should be left unchanged. The rest of the configuration can be customized as needed.

The following is an example that follows on from the previous section and configures SSH to provide a pre-login banner. Both a new `banner` file and a new `sshd_config` are placed in a Kubernetes ConfigMap and mounted over `/etc/switchboard`:

```
# Notice special here document form to prevent variable substitution in the file

ncn-m001-pit# cat <<-"EOF" > banner
Here is a banner that will be displayed before login on
the Broker UAI

EOF

# Notice special here document form to prevent variable substitution in the file

Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server
AcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES
AcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT
AcceptEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL
AcceptEnv UAI_ONE_SHOT
UseDNS no

	ForceCommand /usr/bin/switchboard broker --class-id $UAI_CREATION_CLASS
