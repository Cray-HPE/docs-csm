# Troubleshoot Stale Brokered UAIs

**NOTE:** UAS and UAI are deprecated in CSM 1.5.2 and will be removed in CSM 1.6

When a Broker UAI terminates and restarts, the SSH key used to forward SSH sessions to End-User UAIs changes (this is a known problem) and subsequent Broker UAIs are unable to forward sessions to End-User UAIs.
The symptom of this is that a user logging into a Broker UAI will receive a password prompt from the End-User UAI and be unable to log in even if providing the correct password.
To fix this, remove the stale End-User UAIs and allow the Broker UAI to recreate them. The easy way to do this is to use the command specifying the uai-creation-class identifier from the Broker's UAI class.

```bash
cray uas admin uais delete --class-id <creation-class-id>
```

For example:

```bash
ncn-m001-cray uas admin config classes list | grep -e class_id -e comment
class_id = "74970cdc-9f94-4d51-8f20-96326212b468"
comment = "UAI broker class"
class_id = "a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c"
comment = "UAI User Class"
class_id = "bb28a35a-6cbc-4c30-84b0-6050314af76b"
comment = "Non-Brokered UAI User Class"

ncn-m001-cray uas admin config classes describe 74970cdc-9f94-4d51-8f20-96326212b468 | grep uai_creation_class
uai_creation_class = "a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c"

ncn-m001-cray uas admin uais delete --class-id a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c
results = [ "Successfully deleted uai-vers-6da50e7a",]
```

After that, users should be able to log into the Broker UAI and be directed to an End-User UAI as before.
