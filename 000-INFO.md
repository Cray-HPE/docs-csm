# CRAY Guide Contribution

Contributing is encouraged, anyone can make a pull-request.

All this guide asks is for a few guard-rails to keep things organized ...

# Page Indexing / Naming

The page name can be anything. This repo has a loose pattern to assist tab-completion and contextual
heuristics:

    [XYZ]-[context]-[memo].md

Examples:
    - `010-UAN-DEPLOY.md`
    - `040-CN-DISCOVERY.md`
    - `333-LIVCD-RECOVERY-GUIDE.md`

# Annotations

This repository may change annotations, for now under the MarkDown governance these are the available annotions.

**You must use these to denote the right steps to the right audience.**

These are context clues for steps, if they contain these and you are not in that context you ought to skip them.

> **`AIRGAP/OFFLINE USE`**

This tag should preface any block that is for offline install steps or procedures, where there is 
no online/internet connection.

> **`EXTERNAL USE`** 

This tag should be used to highlight anything that an internal user should ignore or skip.

> **`INTERNAL USE`** 

This tag should be before any block of instruction or text that is only usable or recommended for 
internal CRAY labs.

External (GitHub or customer) should disregard these annotated blocks - they maybe contain useful
information but are not intended for their use.
 

> **`PREFERRED`** use the generated files from your system inputs...
> **`MANUAL`** without CPT files generated by CSI...

These tags denote forks in a direction, denoting a fallback or manual method of the faster/preferred 
method is not doable in the given context.
