## Additions and improvements

### Hardware support

### General

* Added new `FabricManager` subrole to SMD.

### Security

* Updated several HMS services to point to latest upstream image and Go module dependencies.

### Tests

* Fixed several issues in HMS services that resulted in false positives when CT tests were run.

## Customer-requested

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in SMD where HTTP code 400 was returned if a GET on the lock status API found no matching components.  HTTP code 200 is now returned along with an empty list.
* Fixed a bug in CAPMC where power requests would fail if too many xnames were specified.

## Known issues

* In multi-tenant configurations leveraging Slingshot networking as described in the "HPE Slingshot Network Operator for CSM Multi-Tenancy"
  section of the HPE Slingshot Administration Guide, the iSCSI protocol cannot be routed over the High-Speed Network (HSN). While compute
  nodes remain in the same HSN subnet, they are assigned to a different VLAN than Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs). This VLAN isolation prevents
  compute nodes from accessing iSCSI services hosted on NCNs via the HSN.

  Compute nodes must be configured to use iSCSI over the Node Management Network (NMN) to successfully boot and to prevent iSCSI access
  issues when running nodes are moved into tenant-specific VLANs.
