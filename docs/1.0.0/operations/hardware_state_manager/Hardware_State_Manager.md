# Hardware State Manager \(HSM\)

The Hardware State Manager \(HSM\) monitors and interrogates hardware components in the HPE Cray EX system, tracking hardware state and inventory information, and making it available via REST queries and message bus events when changes occur.

In the CSM 0.9.3 release, v1 of the HSM API has begun its deprecation process in favor of the new HSM v2 API. Refer to the HSM API documentation for more information on the changes.
