# Special Purpose UAIs

Even though most UAIs are end-user UAIs, [UAI classes](UAI_Classes.md) make it possible to construct UAIs to serve special purposes that are not strictly end-user oriented.

One kind of special purpose UAI is the broker UAI, which provides on demand end-user UAI launch and management (see [Broker Mode UAI Management](Broker_Mode_UAI_Management.md)). While no other specialty UAI types currently exist, other applications are expected to arise and users are encouraged to innovate as needed.
