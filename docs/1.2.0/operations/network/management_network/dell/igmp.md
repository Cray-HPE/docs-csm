# Configure Internet Group Multicast Protocol (IGMP)

The Internet Group Multicast Protocol (IGMP) is a communications protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers on IP networks to establish multicast group memberships.
The host joins a multicast-group by sending a join request message towards the network router, and responds to queries sent from the network router by dispatching a join report.

## Configuration Command

```text
switch(config)# ip igmp snooping enable
```

## Expected Results

`show ip igmp-snooping vlan 1` should show IGMP enabled on the VLAN, but no IGMP Querier set
