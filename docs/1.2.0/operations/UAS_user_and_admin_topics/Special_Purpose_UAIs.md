# Special Purpose UAIs

Even though most UAIs are End-User UAIs, [UAI classes](UAI_Classes.md) make it possible to construct UAIs to serve special purposes that are not strictly end-user oriented.

One kind of special purpose UAI is the [Broker UAI](Broker_Mode_UAI_Management.md), which provides on demand End-User UAI launch and management.
While no other specialty UAI types currently exist, other applications are expected to arise and sites are encouraged to [innovate as needed](Customize_End-User_UAI_Images.md).
