# Cray System Management (CSM) - Release Notes
## Whatâ€™s new
## Bug Fixes
## Known Issues
- Incorrect_output_for_bos_command_rerun: When a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session fails, it may output a message in the Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) log associated with that session. This output contains a command that instructs the user how to re-run the failed session. It will only contain the nodes that failed during that session. The command is faulty, and this issue addresses correcting it.
- Cfs_session_stuck_in_pending: Under some circumstances CFS sessions can get stuck in a pending state, never completing and potentially blocking other sessions.  This addresses cleaning up those sessions.
