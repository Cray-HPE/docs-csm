### Security vulnerability exceptions in CSM 1.3

Significant effort went into the tracking, elimination, and/or reduction of critical or high (and lower) security vulnerabilities of container images included in the CSM 1.3 release.
There remain, however, a small number of exceptions that are listed below. General reasons for carrying exceptions include needing to version pin certain core components,
upstream fixes not being available, or new vulnerability detection or fixes occurring after release content is frozen. A new effort to track and address security vulnerabilities
of container images spins up with each major CSM release.

| Image | Reason |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `csm-dckr/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.15`                                | This version of Ceph (Octopus) is needed in the upgrade procedure, but is not present after that. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.16`                              | This version of Ceph (Octopus) is needed in the upgrade procedure, but is not present after that. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v16.2.9`                               | This version of Ceph (Pacific) is pinned for the CSM 1.3 release.  The next CSM version released as a part of a recipe will support Ceph (`Quincy`). |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/cephcsi/cephcsi:v3.6.2`                          | Upstream fixes became available after CSM 1.3 release content was frozen. |
| `csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/bitnami/external-dns:0.10.2-debian-10-r23`         | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/kiali/kiali-operator:v1.36.7`                    | The updated `RedHat` base image is available but not pulled in by upstream.  See procedure to [Remove Kiali](operations/system_management_health/Remove_Kiali.md) if desired. |
| `csm-dckr/stable/k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.20.13`                            | This version is needed for the upgrade procedure but will not be running after the upgrade has been completed. |
| `csm-docker/stable/k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.21.12`                          | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available for the `1.21.12` version of Kubernetes included in CSM 1.3. |
| `csm-docker/stable/cray-postgres-db-backup:0.2.3`                           | To ensure success of postgres restore functionality, we needed to pin to psql v12 in this image |
| `csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/nfvpe/multus:v3.7`                                 | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available, however we have engaged with the project to make a reduced-vulnerability version available.|
| `csm-docker/stable/docker.io/sonatype/nexus3:3.38.0-1`                      | Upstream fixes are needed to the base image in order to address the remaining vulnerabilities. |
| `csm-docker/stable/cray-uas-mgr:1.21.0`                                     | This will be addressed in a future version of CSM. |
