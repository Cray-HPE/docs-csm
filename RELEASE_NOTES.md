### DHCP

#### Changed

* **Kea**: Fixed a bug that could cause the auto-repair logic to fail due to an incorrect index

### DNS

#### Changed

* **`ExternalDNS`**: Fixed a bug where `cray-externaldns-manager` could panic if it couldn't connect to PowerDNS on startup
* **PowerDNS**: Changed `powerdns-manager` SLS error message to debug

### Management Network

#### Added

* **Documentation**: Added procedure to migrate from the customer access network (CAN) to the customer high-speed network (CHN), allowing user traffic over
  the HSN instead of the NMN (This is an extension of the `bi-furcated` CAN feature that shipped in CSM 1.2)
* **Documentation**: Added various troubleshooting guides

* **CANU**: Added an ACL on systems with Dell and Mellanox switches to prevent high-speed network (HSN) switches on the Hardware Management Network (HMN)
  from communicating with the Fabric Manager service on the Node Management Network (NMN) API gateway
* **CSI**: Fixed bug where CSI could generate bad SLS chassis data
* **Documentation**: Admins are now asked to updated CANU to the latest version when beginning a CSM upgrade
* **Documentation**: Management network switch upgrade instructs are now separate from the CSM upgrade procedure

## Bug fixes

* TBD

## Deprecations

The following features are now deprecated and will be removed from CSM in a future release.

* [BOS](glossary.md#boot-orchestration-service-bos) v1 is now deprecated, in favor of BOS v2. BOS v1 will be removed from CSM in a future release.
  * It is likely that even prior to BOS v1 being removed from CSM, the [Cray CLI](glossary.md#cray-cli-cray) will change its behavior when no
    version is explicitly specified in BOS commands. Currently it defaults to BOS v1, but it may change to default to BOS v2 even before BOS v1
    is removed from CSM.

For a list of all deprecated CSM features, including those that were deprecated in previous CSM releases but have not yet been removed,
see [Deprecated Features](introduction/deprecated_features/README.md).

## Removals

## Known issues

### Security vulnerability exceptions in CSM 1.3

Significant effort went into the tracking, elimination, and/or reduction of critical or high (and lower) security vulnerabilities of container images included in the CSM 1.3 release.
There remain, however, a small number of exceptions that are listed below. General reasons for carrying exceptions include needing to version pin certain core components,
upstream fixes not being available, or new vulnerability detection or fixes occurring after release content is frozen. A new effort to track and address security vulnerabilities
of container images spins up with each major CSM release.

| Image | Reason |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `csm-dckr/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.15`                                | This version of Ceph (Octopus) is needed in the upgrade procedure, but is not present after that. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.16`                              | This version of Ceph (Octopus) is needed in the upgrade procedure, but is not present after that. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v16.2.9`                               | This version of Ceph (Pacific) is pinned for the CSM 1.3 release.  The next CSM version released as a part of a recipe will support Ceph (`Quincy`). |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/cephcsi/cephcsi:v3.6.2`                          | Upstream fixes became available after CSM 1.3 release content was frozen. |
| `csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/bitnami/external-dns:0.10.2-debian-10-r23`         | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available. |
| `csm-docker/stable/quay.io/kiali/kiali-operator:v1.36.7`                    | The updated `RedHat` base image is available but not pulled in by upstream.  See procedure to [Remove Kiali](operations/system_management_health/Remove_Kiali.md) if desired. |
| `csm-dckr/stable/k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.20.13`                            | This version is needed for the upgrade procedure but will not be running after the upgrade has been completed. |
| `csm-docker/stable/k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.21.12`                          | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available for the `1.21.12` version of Kubernetes included in CSM 1.3. |
| `csm-docker/stable/cray-postgres-db-backup:0.2.3`                           | To ensure success of `postgres` restore functionality, we needed to pin to `psql v12` in this image. |
| `csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/nfvpe/multus:v3.7`                                 | Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available, however we have engaged with the project to make a reduced-vulnerability version available.|
| `csm-docker/stable/docker.io/sonatype/nexus3:3.38.0-1`                      | Upstream fixes are needed to the base image in order to address the remaining vulnerabilities. |
| `csm-docker/stable/cray-uas-mgr:1.21.0`                                     | This will be addressed in a future version of CSM. |
