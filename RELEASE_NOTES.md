# Cray System Management (CSM) - Release Notes

## CSM 1.2.0

CSM 1.2 contains approximately 2000 changes spanning bug fixes, new feature development, and documentation improvements. This page lists some of the highlights.

## New

### Monitoring

* New network traffic dashboard
* New Kubernetes and microservice health dashboard
* New boot dashboard
* New command line dashboard for critical services like `smd`, `smd-postgres`, `capmc`, and `hbtd`
* New Grafana dashboard for critical services like `smd`, `capmc`, `smd-postgres`, and `hbtd`
* Management nodes sample SMART data and publish it to SMA/SMF
* Support for HPE PDU telemetry

### Networking

* Release Cray Automated Network Utility (CANU) V1.0.0
* Performance improvements to Unbound and DHCP helper
* Initial release of Bifurcated CAN

  The user and administrative traffic segregation introduced by Bifurcated CAN has changed the URLs for certain services as it is now necessary to include the network path in the
  fully qualified domain name. Access to administrative services is now restricted to the Customer Management Network (CMN). API access is available via the Customer Management
  Network (CMN), Customer Access Network (CAN), and Customer Highspeed Network (CHN).

  The following table assumes the system was configured with a `system-name` of `shasta` and a `site-domain` of `dev.cray.com`.

  | Old Name                           | New Name                                  |

    [PowerDNS Configuration Guide](operations/network/dns/PowerDNS_Configuration.md) for further information.
* Management network switch hostname changes

  The management network switch hostnames changed in CSM 1.2 to more accurately reflect the usage of each switch type.

  | Old Name   | New Name      | Usage                                                     |
  |------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | `sw-spine` | Unchanged     | Network spine that links to other switches.               |
  | `sw-agg`   | `sw-leaf`     | NMN connections for NCNs and application nodes.           |
  | `sw-leaf`  | `sw-leaf-bmc` | BMC connections, PDUs, Slingshot switches, cooling doors  |

* PowerDNS will replace Unbound as the authoritative DNS source in a future CSM release.
  * The `cray-dns-unbound-manager` CronJob will be deprecated in a future release once all DNS records are migrated to PowerDNS.
  * The introduction of PowerDNS and Bifurcated CAN will introduce some node and service naming changes.
  * See the [PowerDNS Migration Guide](operations/network/dns/PowerDNS_migration.md) for more information.

See [Deprecated features](introduction/differences.md#deprecated_features).

## Removals

* The V1 version of the CFS API has been removed
* The `cray-externaldns-coredns`, `cray-externaldns-etcd`, and `cray-externaldns-wait-for-etcd` pods have been removed. PowerDNS is now the provider of the external DNS service.

## Known issues

### Security Vulnerability Exceptions in CSM 1.2

A great deal of emphasis was placed on elimination or reduction of critical or high security vulnerabilities of container images included in the CSM 1.2 release.
There remain, however, a small number of exceptions that are listed below. General reasons for carrying exceptions include needing to version pin certain core components,
upstream fixes not being available, or new vulnerability detection or fixes occurring after release content is frozen. A new effort to track and address security vulnerabilities
of container images spins up with each major CSM release.

* csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.8 - This image is needed for the procedure to upgrade to CSM 1.2, but is purged afterward.
* csm-dckr/stable/quay.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.15 - This version of Ceph (Octopus) is pinned for the CSM 1.2 release. The next major version of CSM will support Ceph (Pacific).
* csm-dckr/stable/quay.io/cephcsi/cephcsi:v3.5.1 - Upstream fixes became available after CSM 1.2 release content was frozen.
* quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:v7.2.1 - The latest tagged image was pinned to use alpine:3.15.0 and was not addressed upstream until after CSM 1.2 release content was frozen.
* csm-dckr/stable/csm-config:1.9.31 - The vulnerability was discovered after CSM 1.2 release content was frozen and will be addressed in the next major CSM release.
* csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/bitnami/external-dns:0.10.2-debian-10-r23 - Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available.
* csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/nfvpe/multus:v3.1 - Upstream fixes are needed for resolution. However, this image is only needed for the upgrade to  CSM 1.2 and is purged afterward.
* csm-dckr/stable/dckr.io/nfvpe/multus:v3.7 - Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available.
* csm-dckr/stable/quay.io/kiali/kiali:v1.28.1 - Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available.  Note that there is a [procedure for removal of Kiali](operations/system_management_health/Remove_Kiali.md) if desired.
* csm-dckr/stable/k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.20.13 - Upstream fixes are needed and are not yet available for the 1.20.13 version of Kubernetes included in CSM 1.2.
