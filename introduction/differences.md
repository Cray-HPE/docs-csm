### Deprecating Features

   * HSM v1 REST API has been deprecated as of CSM version 0.9.3. The v1 HSM APIs will be removed in the CSM version 1.3 release.
   * Many CAPMC v1 REST API and CLI features are being deprecated as part of CSM version 1.0; Full removal of the deprecated CAPMC features will happen in CSM version 1.3. Further development of CAPMC service or CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release.  The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC are being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS. More information about PCS and the CAPMC transition will be released as part of subsequent CSM releases. 
     * For more information on what features have been removed please view the CAPMC swagger doc or read the [CAPMC deprecation notice](../introduction/CAPMC_deprecation.md)

   * The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) API is changing in the upcoming CSM-1.2.0 release:
        * The `--template-body` option for the Cray CLI `bos` command will be deprecated.
        * Performing a GET on the session status for a boot set (i.e. `/v1/session/{session_id}/status/{boot_set_name}`) currently returns a status code of 201, but instead it should return a status code of 200. This will be corrected to return 200.
