# Deprecated Features

This page lists deprecated features in CSM. They are no longer being actively developed and are planned to be removed in a future CSM release.

When a feature is first deprecated, it may not yet be announced in which CSM version that feature will be fully removed. When such a decision has
been made, that information will be available on this page. For any deprecated features listed on this page that do not yet have an announced CSM
version for their planned removal, customers are still strongly encouraged to make plans to migrate away from the deprecated feature.
