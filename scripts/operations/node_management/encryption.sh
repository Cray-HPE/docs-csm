# - etc.....
# - Note that a call of encryptionconfig identity should only occur when turning encryption off entirely after it was on.
# - Identity is *always* required, it controls where in the provider array the identity provider shows up. This is used for key rotation and to bring k8s up when switching to a new encryption key. As any data is not encrypted at that point in etcd we need to be able to read the data to re-encrypt later.
# - Note: identity is an internal only thing, users don't specify this directly but implicitly by turning encryption on or off.
# - Order of callers determines what will/can be used for encryption.
# - Note: This encryptionconfig could use some cleaning up in how it lays out providers less redundantly. But an added bonus is it makes positional keys easy to specify.
