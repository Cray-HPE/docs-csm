# Reads in:
# - the hashed root user password from /etc/shadow
# - the root user SSH private key from /root/.ssh/id_rsa
# - the root user SSH public key from /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#
# Writes these to the secret/csm/users/root in Vault, and then
# reads them back to verify that they match what was written.
#
# Beyond validating the inputs, currently this script does minimal error-checking.
# This is because it is desirable for any errors to be fatal, so catching the
# Python exceptions is only useful inasmuch as it gives the opportunity to translate
# the error into a more user-friendly format. This is certainly something that should
# eventually be implemented, but for the initial version of this tool, it is not
# necessary.
