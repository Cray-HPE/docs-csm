Usage:

$0 context

context - Description of when the backups are being taken (e.g. 'post_install').
          This string is used for the backup name so the backup can be easily
          identified (e.g. cray-bss/post_install.backup_2022-09-30-20:51:46).
          Note the string proviced for context should contain '_' in order
          for the ncnHealthChecks.sh script to properly parse the timestamp
          from the backup name.
