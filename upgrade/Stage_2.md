# Stage 2 - CSM Service Upgrades

**Reminder:** If any problems are encountered and the procedure or command output does not provide relevant guidance, see

## Start typescript

1. (`ncn-m002#`) If a typescript session is already running in the shell, then first stop it with the `exit` command.

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Start a typescript.

    ```bash
    script -af /root/csm_upgrade.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).stage_2.txt
    export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
    ```

If additional shells are opened during this procedure, then record those with typescripts as well. When resuming a procedure
after a break, always be sure that a typescript is running before proceeding.

## Perform upgrade

During this stage there will be a brief (approximately five minutes) window where pods with Persistent Volumes (`PV`s) will not be able to migrate between nodes.
This is due to a redeployment of the Ceph `csi` provisioners into namespaces, in order to accommodate the newer charts and a better upgrade strategy.

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Set the `SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.

   Set it to the `admin` user password for the switches. This is required for post-upgrade tests.

   > `read -s` is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.

   ```bash
   read -s SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
   ```

   ```bash
   export SW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
   ```

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Perform the upgrade.

   Run `csm-upgrade.sh` to deploy upgraded CSM applications and services.

   ```bash
   /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/scripts/upgrade/csm-upgrade.sh
   ```

## Verify Keycloak users

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Verify that the Keycloak users localize job has completed as expected.

    > This step can be skipped if user localization is not required.

    After an upgrade, it is possible that all expected Keycloak users were not localized.
    See [Verification procedure](../operations/security_and_authentication/Keycloak_User_Localization.md#Verification-procedure)
    to confirm that Keycloak localization has completed as expected.

## Take Etcd Manual Backup

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Execute the following script to take a manual backup of the Etcd clusters.
   These clusters are automatically backed up every 24 hours, but taking a manual backup
   at this stage in the upgrade enables restoring from backup later in this process if needed.

   ```bash
   /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/etcd/take-etcd-manual-backups.sh post_upgrade
   ```

## Stop typescript

For any typescripts that were started during this stage, stop them with the `exit` command.

## Stage completed

This stage is completed. Proceed to [Validate CSM health](README.md#3-validate-csm-health) on the main upgrade page.
