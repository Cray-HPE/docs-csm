## Start typescript

1. (`ncn-m001#`) If a typescript session is already running in the shell, then first stop it with the `exit` command.

1. (`ncn-m001#`) Start a typescript.

    ```bash
    script -af /root/csm_upgrade.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).stage_1.txt
    export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
    ```

If additional shells are opened during this procedure, then record those with typescripts as well. When resuming a procedure
after a break, always be sure that a typescript is running before proceeding.

## Apply boot order workaround

(`ncn-m001#`) Apply a workaround for the boot order:

```bash
/usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/workarounds/boot-order/run.sh
```

## Argo workflows

Before starting [Storage node image upgrade](#storage-node-image-upgrade), access the Argo UI to view the progress of this stage.
Note that the progress for the current stage will not show up in Argo before the storage node image upgrade script has been started.

For more information, see [Using the Argo UI](../operations/argo/Using_the_Argo_UI.md) and [Using Argo Workflows](../operations/argo/Using_Argo_Workflows.md).

## CSM Upgrade requirement for upgrades staying within a CSM release version

**IMPORTANT:**

> If the upgrade is staying with a CSM release, e.g. `CSM-1.3.0-rc1` to `CSM-1.3.0-rc2`, then you will need to run the following to point the Ceph cluster to use the Ceph container image stored in Nexus.
> The issue stems from slightly different `sha` values for the Ceph containers for in-family CSM storage node images which will prevent the Ceph containers from starting.
> This will utilize the upgrade procedure to accomplish this as it has built in checks and health monitoring to better manage this rolling restart of the Ceph containers with the image stored in Nexus.  Please see [cubs_tool usage for further information](../operations/utility_storage/Cubs_tool_Usage.md)

(`ncn-s001#`) In family upgrade to a new container with the same Ceph version:

```bash
/srv/cray/scripts/common/cubs_tool.py --version v16.2.9 --registry registry.local/artifactory.algol60.net/csm-docker/stable/quay.io --upgrade --in_family_override
```

## Storage node image upgrade

(`ncn-m001#`) Run `ncn-upgrade-worker-storage-nodes.sh` for all storage nodes to be upgraded. Provide the storage nodes in a comma-separated list, such as `ncn-s001,ncn-s002,ncn-s003`. This upgrades the storage nodes sequentially.

```bash
/usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/scripts/upgrade/ncn-upgrade-worker-storage-nodes.sh ncn-s001,ncn-s002,ncn-s003
```

**`NOTE`**
It is possible to upgrade a single storage node at a time using the following command.

```bash
/usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/scripts/upgrade/ncn-upgrade-worker-storage-nodes.sh ncn-s001
```

>**Storage node image upgrade troubleshooting**
>
> - The best troubleshooting tool for this stage is the Argo UI. Information about accessing this UI and about using Argo Workflows is above.
> - If the upgrade is 'waiting for ceph HEALTH_OK', the output from commands `ceph -s` and `ceph health detail` should provide information.
> - Refer to [storage troubleshooting documentation](../operations/utility_storage/Utility_Storage.md#storage-troubleshooting-references) for Ceph related issues.

## Ensure that `rbd` stats monitoring is enabled

(`ncn-m001#`) Run the following commands to enable the `rbd` stats collection on the pools.

```bash
ceph config set mgr mgr/prometheus/rbd_stats_pools "kube,smf"
ceph config set mgr mgr/prometheus/rbd_stats_pools_refresh_interval 600
```

## Stop typescript

For any typescripts that were started during this stage, stop them with the `exit` command.

## Stage completed

All the Ceph nodes have been rebooted into the new image.

This stage is completed. Continue to [Stage 2](Stage_2.md).
