# Upgrade CSM

There are several alternative procedures to perform an upgrade of Cray Systems Management (CSM)
software. Choose the appropriate procedure from the sections below.

## Option 1: Upgrade CSM with additional HPE Cray EX software products

To perform an upgrade of CSM along with additional HPE Cray EX software products, see the
[Upgrade CSM and additional products with IUF](../operations/iuf/workflows/upgrade_csm_and_additional_products_with_iuf.md)
procedure.

This is the most common procedure to follow, and it should be used when performing an upgrade from
one HPC CSM software recipe to another.

## Option 2: Upgrade only additional HPE Cray EX software products

To perform an upgrade of only the additional HPE Cray EX software products without
simultaneously upgrading CSM itself, see the
[Install or upgrade additional products with IUF](../operations/iuf/workflows/install_or_upgrade_additional_products_with_iuf.md)
procedure.

## Option 3: Upgrade only CSM

To perform an upgrade of only CSM, see the [Upgrade Only CSM](Upgrade_Only_CSM.md) procedure.

This option applies to CSM-only systems and systems which have additional HPE Cray EX software
products installed, as long as those additional products are not also being upgraded. This is an
uncommon upgrade scenario.
