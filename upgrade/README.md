# Upgrade CSM

There are several alternative procedures to perform an upgrade of Cray Systems Management (CSM)
software. Choose the appropriate procedure from the sections below.

* [Release Notes](#release-notes)
    * [NVIDIA CPU and GPU notice](#nvidia-cpu-and-gpu-notice)
    * [BOS data notice](#bos-data-notice)
* [CSM major/minor version upgrade](#csm-majorminor-version-upgrade)
    * [Option 1: Upgrade CSM with additional HPE Cray EX software products](#option-1-upgrade-csm-with-additional-hpe-cray-ex-software-products)
    * [Option 2: Upgrade only additional HPE Cray EX software products](#option-2-upgrade-only-additional-hpe-cray-ex-software-products)
    * [Option 3: Upgrade only CSM](#option-3-upgrade-only-csm)
* [CSM patch version upgrade](#csm-patch-version-upgrade)

## Release Notes

Before upgrading, review the [Release Notes](../RELEASE_NOTES.md)

### NVIDIA CPU and GPU notice

Servers with NVIDIA CPUs and GPUs are **not** supported by CSM 1.6.0. Systems with these servers should
**not** be upgraded to CSM 1.6.0.

The January 2025 HPE HPC continuous software stack releases (CSM 1.6.0) are for HPE Cray EX systems without NVIDIA CPUs and GPUs.
For HPE Cray EX systems with NVIDIA CPUs and GPUs, please use the August 2024 (CSM 1.5.x) HPE HPC continuous software stack.
These software stacks were validated with NVIDIA HPC SDK 24.3.

The March 2025 HPE HPC continuous and extended software stack releases will be validated with NVIDIA HPC SDK 24.11.
The March 2025 (CSM 1.6.1) software stacks will support all HPE Cray EX systems.

### BOS data notice

In CSM 1.6, BOS v1 is removed and the BOS API is enforcing various limits that previously had only been recommended.
Most of these limits are unlikely to be violated in practice (for example, the `description` field of session templates
is limited to 1023 characters in length).

When first upgrading to CSM 1.6, all BOS v1 session data is deleted, and all other BOS data is checked for
compliance with the API specification. It will attempt to automatically convert data to be in compliance with the
specification (for example, by truncating `description` fields that are longer than 1023 characters), but in rare
cases it may delete data. In general, if the migration deletes a session template, then it likely contains a fatal problem that
would have prevented it from working.

Regardless of the upgrade path that is used, a backup of the current BOS data is made before the BOS service is upgraded,
and a snapshot of the BOS data is also taken after the data migration completes. Both of these are uploaded to S3,
in either the `config-data` or `vbis` buckets. In addition, the `cray-bos-migration-` Kubernetes pod log contains a record
of any changes that were made during the migration. This pod log is also collected as part of the post-migration snapshot.

## CSM major/minor version upgrade

Follow one of these procedures when upgrading from CSM 1.5 to CSM 1.6 (regardless of patch version).
(Additionally, in the unusual situation of upgrading from a pre-release version of CSM 1.6.0, then one of these
procedure should be followed.)

There is no need to upgrade from CSM 1.5 to CSM 1.6.0, and then separately upgrade from CSM 1.6.0 to the
latest patch release. The procedures in this section can be used to upgrade from CSM 1.5 directly to the
latest patch release of CSM 1.6.

### Option 1: Upgrade CSM with additional HPE Cray EX software products

To perform an upgrade of CSM along with additional HPE Cray EX software products, see the
[Upgrade CSM and additional products](../operations/iuf/workflows/upgrade_csm_and_additional_products.md)
procedure.

This is the most common procedure to follow, and it should be used when performing an upgrade from
one HPC CSM software recipe to another.

### Option 2: Upgrade only additional HPE Cray EX software products

To perform an upgrade of only the additional HPE Cray EX software products without
simultaneously upgrading CSM itself, see the
[Install or upgrade additional products with IUF](../operations/iuf/workflows/install_or_upgrade_additional_products_with_iuf.md)
procedure.

### Option 3: Upgrade only CSM

There are two options to perform an upgrade of only CSM:

1. [Upgrade Only CSM without IUF](Upgrade_Only_CSM_without_iuf.md) procedure.

1. [Upgrade Only CSM with IUF](Upgrade_Only_CSM_with_iuf.md) procedure.

This option applies to CSM-only systems and systems which have additional HPE Cray EX software
products installed, as long as those additional products are not also being upgraded. This is an
uncommon upgrade scenario.

**Note: Beyond CSM 1.6 IUF will be the only option to upgrade CSM with or without additional HPE Cray EX software products.**

## CSM patch version upgrade

Follow one of these procedures when upgrading from CSM 1.6 to a newer patch version of CSM 1.6.
(The one exception is in the unusual situation of upgrading from a pre-release version of CSM 1.6.0;
in that case, follow the [CSM major/minor version upgrade](#csm-majorminor-version-upgrade)
procedures).

If there are multiple patch versions available, note that there is no need to perform intermediate
CSM 1.6 patch upgrades. Instead, consider upgrading to the latest CSM 1.6 patch release.

There are no CSM 1.6 patch versions currently available. When any become available, they will
be listed here.
