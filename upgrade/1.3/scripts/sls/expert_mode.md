# SLS Updates Expert Mode

The 1.3 SLS Upgrader aims to make the upgrade of SLS from pre-CMS 1.3 to CSM 1.3 as seamless as possible. However, certain system constraints and subnet sizes quickly necessitate overriding standard input.

***Key Takeaways***

1. *EXPERT MODE:* requires both an iterative (offline) process and command line override values.
2. The output from the upgrade is a *file*, not uploaded live to the system.
3. The output logs from an upgrade run should be reviewed to ensure that input values and upgrader subnetting has the desired effect.

***When to use Expert Mode***

* Both external-dns and ncn IPs need to be preserved.
* Subnets created by the upgrader are in the wrong order, too small or a subnet size and location in a network needs to be enforced.
* Running in non-expert mode generates errors.
* Running in non-expert mode generates warnings for which remediation is desired.

## Simple/Minimal Input Review

The upgrader requires only two inputs:

* SLS input file: This is a file extract of SLS to be upgraded.
* Bifurcated CAN path for non-administrator traffic: Selection of CAN or CHN depending on whether User traffic (users running jobs, not administrators) will access the system over
  the management network CAN or the highspeed network (CHN).

An example of this would be:

```bash
ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
        --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
        --bican-user-network-name CAN
```

The above example will use *default values* for all other input values. A list of input parameters and default values can be found by running `./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py --help`.
Likely using default VLAN and Network values will not be what is desired: The CAN or CHN are usually site-routable values.

In this case an example minimal usable input while using CAN, would be:

```bash
ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
        --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
        --bican-user-network-name CAN \
        --customer-access-network <CAN VLAN ID> <CAN NETORK CIDR>
```

For CHN the analog minimal usable input would be:

```bash
ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
        --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
        --bican-user-network-name CHN \
        --customer-highspeed-network <CHN VLAN ID> <CHN NETWORK CIDR>
```

## Forcing Preservation of (some) Existing Values

As part of the upgrade process an exist CAN is migrated to a CSM 1.3 Customer Management Network (CMN). The reasoning behind this was that most systems in production currently use
the CAN as an administrative network. Additionally, and more operationally important, system IP addresses shared with the site (External DNS for instance) are administrative IP
addresses, and it is often more difficult to change these IP addresses than it is to make changes in software and avoid operational changes.

To allow some semblance of control over the need to preserve one or more IP addresses (existing CAN, migrated CMN only), the `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn` was introduced.
`--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn` has two possible values:

* `external-dns`: This is the IP address by which customer/site DNS lookups to system internal (K8S services) DNS happen. Often changing this **requires** operational change control
  from the site. **NOTE:** `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns` is the most frequent use of this command line flag.
* `ncns`: During the migration of CAN to CMN, all system switches need to be added to a (new) `network_hardware` subnet inside the CMN Network. Without guidance, NCN IP addresses for
the existing CAN (as it is migrated to CMN) will shift to allow room for the new `network_hardware` subnet. Using `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn ncns` will prevent changes to CMN
NCN IP addresses (managers, workers and storage only) during the upgrade process.

Note that `external-dns` preservation is mutually exclusive from `ncns`. This is the last "easy button" before full "expert mode" is required.

A very common (and recommended) next step minimal command line is as follows for a system desiring the CHN with no change of the `external-dns` value:

```bash
ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
        --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
        --bican-user-network-name CHN \
        --customer-highspeed-network <CHN VLAN ID> <CHN NETWORK CIDR> \
        --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns
```

This creates a new CHN and migrates the existing CAN to the new CMN, while maintaining the `external-dns` IP address in the process. Note that this command line would very likely change
existing CAN/CMN addresses on manager, worker, and storage NCNs during the upgrade to CSM 1.3.

**NOTE:** The output of the upgrader is to a file, not the screen. The logged output of the upgrader should be used as a guide and reviewed.

For example, using:

```bash
ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json --bican-user-network-name CAN \
        --customer-access-network 6 10.103.11.128/25 --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns
```

The log output for migration/converting the existing CAN to the new CMN looks like:

```text

That is quite a bit of output, but some critical points are:

* The upgrader indeed knows that we have asked to preserve the `external-dns` IP address and is `Attempting to preserve metallb_static pool subnet cmn_metallb_static_pool`.
* The order in which CAN subnets will be migrated to the CMN is: `['metallb_static_pool', 'metallb_address_pool', 'network_hardware', 'bootstrap_dhcp']`.
* After each subnet is allocated, the remaining subnets available (for the next step) are listed. For example:
  `Remaining subnets: ['10.103.11.0/27', '10.103.11.32/28', '10.103.11.48/29', '10.103.11.56/30']`.
* The `bootstrap_dhcp` subnet (K8S NCNs) is large enough to create the NCNs but NOT large enough to create a DHCP pool effectively:
  `WARNING: Insufficient IPv4 addresses to create DHCP ranges - 13 devices in a subnet supporting 14 devices.` Technically the SLS file generated by this run will work,
  but a system or network administrator will likely need some pool of addresses in `bootstrap_dhcp` and this warning should be remediated.

## Expert Mode: Overriding Defaults and Forced Guiding of Upgrades

As might be observed from the above example, due to pre-upgrade subnet sizes, or multiple constraints, the "easy" input values might not be sufficient for some systems. This requires "expert mode".

### Expert Mode Prerequisites

* Knowledge of system and site network parameters (IPv4 addresses and subnets as well as VLANs).
* The ability to create subnets from a given network, or ability to read output subnet values, make an educated decision, and modify upgrader input values for the next run.
* Slow down, be patient.

### Expert Mode Process

1. Review the existing networks and subnets in the SLS input file.
2. Make an educated guess about how `sls_updater_csm_1.3.py` should work and run the program. A typical first pass is to `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns`.
3. Review the logged output, noting warnings and errors as well as the location and size of subnets.
    1. Copy the first entry in the log which says `Creating subnets in the following order`.
        1. If `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns` was used, remove the `metallb_address_pool` from the subnets list.
        2. If `--preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns` was used, remove `bootstrap_dhcp` from the subnets list.
    2. Copy the first entry in the log which says `Remaining subnets`. This provides the canonical list from which remaining subnets in the previous entry can be assigned IP addresses.
4. Add override command line values to override the upgrader's default logic and pin subnet allocations for each network. This is a manual step, but is safe
   because the upgrader produced both the list of subnets and the subnet IPAM allocations. Users are simply assigning subnets from a fixed list and a pre-allocated list of IPv4 subnets.
5. Re-run the upgrader with the new parameters.
6. Repeat the process, if necessary.

### Example

For this example of expert mode a very common use case is used with the following requirements:

1. The user network will be the CHN.
2. The external-dns IP must be maintained to avoid operational changes to the site/customer network.
3. The upgrade to CSM 1.3 will be a rolling upgrade, not a full outage. In order to prevent race conditions during the rolling upgrade with temporary IP overlaps, preservation of the K8S NCN IPs for CAN (CMN) are required.

The focus of the process that follows will be on the CMN IP allocations. The same process may be used for the CAN.

**Process:**

1. Review of the existing SLS file for CAN shows that NCN addresses are in the range: `10.103.11.3` to `10.103.11.14` with a DHCP Pool above this.

2. An educated first pass is to run the updater while preserving the external-dns IP only and look for the CMN output:

    ```bash
    ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
            --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
            --bican-user-network-name CHN \
            --customer-highspeed-network 55 172.16.0.0/16 \
            --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns
    ```

    Example log output:

    ```text
    ...snip...
    Converting existing CAN network to CMN.
        Attempting to preserve metallb_static pool subnet cmn_metallb_static_pool to pin external-dns IPv4 address
        Creating subnets in the following order ['metallb_static_pool', 'metallb_address_pool', 'network_hardware', 'bootstrap_dhcp']
        Calculating seed/start prefix based on devices in case no further guidance is given
            INFO: Overrides may be provided on the command line with --<can|cmn>-subnet-override.
        Preserving cmn_metallb_static_pool with 10.103.11.60/30
        Remaining subnets: ['10.103.11.64/26', '10.103.11.0/27', '10.103.11.32/28', '10.103.11.48/29', '10.103.11.56/30']
    ...snip...
    ```

3. Identify and copy the important log output:

    1. `Creating subnets in the following order ['metallb_static_pool', 'metallb_address_pool', 'network_hardware', 'bootstrap_dhcp']`
        1. external-dns was preserved so metallb_static_pool is removed from the available list.
    2. `Remaining subnets: ['10.103.11.64/26', '10.103.11.0/27', '10.103.11.32/28', '10.103.11.48/29', '10.103.11.56/30']`

4. The user task is to map named subnets into IP subnet ranges based on required and desired constraints and develop `--cmn-subnet-override` parameters from the mapping.

    1. Another immediate constraint is to preserve NCN IP addresses for CAN as it is transformed into the CMN. NCNs are in the `boostrap_dhcp` subnet and review of SLS data confirms
       that NCNs were previously in a range that fits into the new "Remaining subnet" of `10.103.11.0/27`.
    2. Generally another desired constraint is to make the service IP pool allocated to `metallb_address_pool` as large as possible. After removing NCNs from the previous step, the next largest subnet is `10.103.11.64/26` and this will be assigned to `metallb_address_pool`.
    3. The best practice from at this point is to also manually pin the remaining subnets, here only `network_hardware` to provide a fully determinate override. This could be any remaining IP subnet from the list and for the example this becomes `10.103.11.32/28`.
    4. Take a deep breath and assemble the new command line with overrides.

5. The next run of the upgrader for the example looks like:

    ```bash
    ncn# ./sls_updater_csm_1.3.py \
        --sls-input-file sls_input_file.json \
        --bican-user-network-name CHN \
        --customer-highspeed-network 55 172.16.0.0/16 \
        --preserve-existing-subnet-for-cmn external-dns \
        --cmn-subnet-override bootstrap_dhcp 10.103.11.0/27 \
        --cmn-subnet-override cmn_metallb_address_pool 10.103.11.64/26 \
        --cmn-subnet-override network_hardware 10.103.11.32/28
    ```

6. The next run completes successfully and the logs show the following CMN allocations:

    ```text

    ```

After review, the allocations for CMN IP addresses in this run are as prescribed. A similar expert override process can be followed if a CAN is desired rather than a CMN.

This has been a review of the process of using "expert mode" in the 1.3 SLS upgrader. The focus has been on IP address allocation of the CMN network. A very similar process can be
used if the CAN network is desired (instead of a CHN).

**WARNING:** During design and implementation of the SLS upgrader, all attempts were made to safely and accurately migrate and update SLS data.
