# Upgrade CSM

The process for upgrading Cray Systems Management (CSM) has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order.

After the upgrade of CSM software, the CSM health checks will validate the system before doing any other operational
tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components. Once the CSM upgrade has completed, other
product streams for the HPE Cray EX system can be installed or upgraded.

Note: If problems are encountered during the upgrade, some of the topics do have their own troubleshooting
sections, but there is also a general troubleshooting topic.

## Upgrade management nodes and CSM services

The procedure to follow depends on the target CSM version of the upgrade.

* Upgrading **to CSM 1.0.1**

    **IMPORTANT**: Must be at CSM 0.9 (0.9.4 or later) or CSM 1.0.0 in order to upgrade to CSM 1.0.1.

    The upgrade is a guided process starting with [CSM 1.0.1 Upgrade Instructions](1.0.1/README.md).

* Upgrading **to CSM 1.0.10**

    **IMPORTANT**: Must be at CSM 1.0.1 in order to upgrade to CSM 1.0.10.

    The upgrade is a guided process starting with [CSM 1.0.10 Upgrade Instructions](1.0.10/README.md).

* Upgrading **to CSM 1.0.11**

    **IMPORTANT**: Must be at CSM 1.0.0, CSM 1.0.1, or CSM 1.0.10 in order to upgrade to CSM 1.0.11.

    The upgrade is a guided process starting with [CSM 1.0.11 Upgrade Instructions](1.0.11/README.md).

## Update management network

**IMPORTANT**: Only do this step if upgrading from CSM 0.9 (Shasta 1.4). If upgrading from CSM 1.0 (Shasta 1.5), skip this step.

There are new features and functions with Shasta 1.5. Some of these changes were available as patches and hotfixes
for Shasta 1.4, so may already be applied.

* Static Lags from the CDU switches to the CMMs (Aruba and Dell).
* HPE Apollo node port configuration, requires a trunk port to the iLO.
* BGP TFTP static route removal (Aruba).
* BGP passive neighbors (Aruba and Mellanox).

See [Update Management Network](update_management_network.md).

## Validate CSM health

**NOTE:**

* Before performing the health validation, be sure that at least 15 minutes have elapsed
  since the CSM services were upgraded. This allows the various Kubernetes resources to
  initialize and start.
* If the site does not use UAIs, skip UAS and UAI validation. If UAIs are used, there are
  products that configure UAS like Cray Analytics and Cray Programming Environment that
  must be working correctly with UAIs, and should be validated (the procedures for this are
  beyond the scope of this document) prior to validating UAS and UAI. Failures in UAI creation that result
  from incorrect or incomplete installation of these products will generally take the form of UAIs stuck in
  waiting state trying to set up volume mounts.
* Performing the [Booting CSM `barebones` image](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#booting-csm-barebones-image)
  test may be skipped if no compute nodes are available (that is, if all compute nodes are active running
  application workloads).

It is always recommended to run all possible CSM health validation procedures. **At a minimum**, run the
following validation checks to ensure that everything is still working properly after the upgrade.

1. [Platform Health Checks](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#platform-health-checks)
1. [Hardware Management Services Health Checks](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#hms-health-checks)
1. [Software Management Services Validation Utility](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#sms-health-checks)
1. [Validate UAS and UAI Functionality](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#uas-uai-validate)

See [Validate CSM Health](../operations/validate_csm_health.md).

## Update Firmware with FAS

See [Update Firmware with FAS](../operations/firmware/Update_Firmware_with_FAS.md).

## Next Topic

After completion of the firmware update with FAS, the CSM product stream has been fully upgraded and
configured. Refer to the `1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000`
on the [`HPE Customer Support Center`](https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg) for
more information on other product streams to be upgraded and configured after CSM.
