# Stage 0 - Prerequisites and Preflight Checks

> **NOTE:** CSM-1.0.1 or later is required in order to upgrade to CSM-1.0.11.

The following command can be used to check the CSM version on the system:

```bash
ncn# kubectl get cm -n services cray-product-catalog -o json | jq -r '.data.csm'
```

This check will also be conducted in the 'prerequisites.sh' script listed below and will fail if the system is not running CSM-1.0.1 or CSM-1.0.10.

>**`IMPORTANT:`**
>
> Before running any upgrade scripts, be sure the Cray CLI output format is reset to default by running the following command:
>
>```bash
> ncn# unset CRAY_FORMAT
>```

## Stage 0.1 - Install the latest docs RPM

1. Copy the latest document RPM package to `/root` and install it.

    The install scripts will look for this RPM in `/root`, so it is important that you copy it there.

    * Internet Connected

        ```bash
        ncn-m001# wget https://storage.googleapis.com/csm-release-public/shasta-1.5/docs-csm/docs-csm-latest.noarch.rpm -P /root
        ncn-m001# rpm -Uvh --force /root/docs-csm-latest.noarch.rpm
        ```

    * Air Gapped (replace the PATH_TO below with the location of the rpm)

        ```bash
        ncn-m001# cp [PATH_TO_docs-csm-*.noarch.rpm] /root
        ncn-m001# rpm -Uvh --force /root/docs-csm-*.noarch.rpm
        ```

## Stage 0.2 - Reduce CPU Limits If Needed

**`IMPORTANT`**

For TDS systems with only three worker nodes, prior to proceeding with this upgrade CPU limits **MUST** be lowered on several services in order for this upgrade to succeed. See [TDS Lower CPU Requests](../../operations/kubernetes/TDS_Lower_CPU_Requests.md) for information on how to accomplish this.

## Stage 0.3 - Update `customizations.yaml`

Perform these steps to update `customizations.yaml`:

1. Extract `customizations.yaml` from the `site-init` secret:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cd /tmp
    ncn-m001# kubectl -n loftsman get secret site-init -o jsonpath='{.data.customizations\.yaml}' | base64 -d - > /tmp/customizations.yaml
    ```

1. Update `customizations.yaml`:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0.11/scripts/upgrade/update-customizations.sh -i customizations.yaml
    ```

1. Update the `site-init` secret:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init
    ncn-m001# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml
    ```

1. If [using an external Git repository for managing customizations](../../install/prepare_site_init.md#version-control-site-init-files) as recommended,
   clone a local working tree and commit appropriate changes to `customizations.yaml`.

    For example:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# git clone <URL> site-init
    ncn-m001# cp /tmp/customizations.yaml site-init
    ncn-m001# cd site-init
    ncn-m001# git add customizations.yaml
    ncn-m001# git commit -m 'Updates for CSM v1.0.11 configuration from customizations.yaml'
    ncn-m001# git push
    ```

5. Return to the original working directory:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# cd -
    ```

## Stage 0.4 - Execute Prerequisites Check

>**`IMPORTANT:`**
>
> Reminder: Before running any upgrade scripts, be sure the Cray CLI output format is reset to default by running the following command:
>
>```bash
> ncn# unset CRAY_FORMAT
>```

1. Authenticate with the Cray CLI on `ncn-m001`.

    See [Configure the Cray Command Line Interface](../../operations/configure_cray_cli.md) for details on how to do this.

1. Set the `CSM_RELEASE` variable to the correct value for the CSM release upgrade being applied.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# CSM_RELEASE=csm-1.0.11
    ```

1. Run check script:

    **NOTE** The `prerequisites.sh` script will warn that it will unmount `/mnt/pitdata`, but this is not accurate. The script will only unmount it if the script itself mounts it. That is, if it is mounted when the script begins, the script will not unmount it.

    * Option 1 - Internet Connected Environment

        1. Set the `ENDPOINT` variable to the URL of the directory containing the CSM release tarball.

            In other words, the full URL to the CSM release tarball will be `${ENDPOINT}${CSM_RELEASE}.tar.gz`

            **NOTE** This step is optional for Cray/HPE internal installs.

            ```bash
            ncn-m001# ENDPOINT=https://put.the/url/here/
            ```

        1. Run the script

            **NOTE** The `--endpoint` argument is optional for Cray/HPE internal use.

            ```bash
            ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0.11/scripts/upgrade/prerequisites.sh --csm-version $CSM_RELEASE --endpoint $ENDPOINT
            ```

    * Option 2 - Air Gapped Environment

        1. Set the `TAR_DIR` variable to the directory on `ncn-m001` containing the CSM release tarball.

            In other words, the full path to the CSM release tarball will be `${TAR_DIR}/${CSM_RELEASE}.tar.gz`

            ```bash
            ncn-m001# TAR_DIR=/path/to/tarball/dir
            ```

        1. Run the script

            ```bash
            ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0.11/scripts/upgrade/prerequisites.sh --csm-version $CSM_RELEASE --tarball-file ${TAR_DIR}/${CSM_RELEASE}.tar.gz
            ```

**`IMPORTANT:`** If any errors are encountered, then potential fixes should be displayed where the error occurred.

**IF** the upgrade `prerequisites.sh` script fails and does not provide guidance, then try rerunning it. If the failure persists, then open a support ticket for guidance before proceeding.

## Stage 0.5 - Backup VCS Data

To prevent any possibility of losing configuration data, backup the VCS data and store it in a safe location. See [Version_Control_Service_VCS.md](../../operations/configuration_management/Version_Control_Service_VCS.md#backup-and-restore-data) for these procedures.

**`IMPORTANT:`** As part of this stage, **only perform the backup, not the restore**. The backup procedure is being done here as a precautionary step.

## Stage 0.6 - Backup Workload Manager Data

To prevent any possibility of losing Workload Manager configuration data or files, a back-up is required. Please execute all Backup procedures (for the Workload Manager in use) located in the `Troubleshooting and Administrative Tasks` sub-section of the `Install a Workload Manager` section of the `HPE Cray Programming Environment Installation Guide: CSM on HPE Cray EX`. The resulting back-up data should be stored in a safe location off of the system.

## Stage 0.7 - Update the Storage Node runcmds for reboots

1. Obtain an API token:

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# export TOKEN=$(curl -s -k -S -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id=admin-client \
                            -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
                            https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token |
                        jq -r '.access_token')
    ```

1. To prevent accidental storage cloud-init runs and also to ensure the Ceph services are set to auto-start on boot, run the below script.

    ```bash
    ncn-m001# python3 /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/patch-ceph-runcmd.py
    ```

## Stage 0.8 - Backup BSS Data

In the event of a problem during the upgrade which may cause the loss of BSS data, perform the following to preserve this data.

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# cray bss bootparameters list --format=json >bss-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
   ```

The resulting file needs to be saved in the event that BSS data needs to be restored in the future.

## Stage 0.9 - Modify NCN Images

Any site modifications to the images used to boot the management nodes need to be done again
as part of this upgrade. These may include changing the root password, adding different ssh
keys for the root account, or setting a default timezone.

The management nodes deploy with a default password in the image, so it is a recommended best
practice for system security to change the root password in the image so that it is
not the documented default password. In addition to the root password in the image, NCN
personalization should be used to change the password as part of post-boot CFS. The password
in the image should be used when console access is desired during the network boot of a management
node that is being rebuilt, but this password should be different than the one stored in Vault
that is applied by CFS during post-boot NCN personalization to change the on-disk password. Once
NCN personalization has been run, then the password in Vault should be used for console access.

1. Use this procedure to change the k8s-image used for master nodes and worker nodes and the ceph-image
used by utility storage nodes. See
[Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys](../../operations/security_and_authentication/Change_NCN_Image_Root_Password_and_SSH_Keys.md)
for more information.

1. Adjust the version variables used later in the upgrade.

   1. The previous procedure to create the site-customized `k8s-image` and `ceph-image` should have set these variables.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# echo $CEPHNEW
      ncn-m001# echo $K8SNEW
      ```

    2. Check current versions in `/etc/cray/upgrade/csm/myenv`.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# grep CEPH_VERSION /etc/cray/upgrade/csm/myenv
      ncn-m001# grep KUBERNETES_VERSION /etc/cray/upgrade/csm/myenv
      ```

    3. If the `CEPH_VERSION` or `KUBERNETES_VERSION` does not match the `CEPHNEW` and `K8SNEW` settings, edit the file.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# vi /etc/cray/upgrade/csm/myenv
      ```

2. Use this procedure to change the root password in Vault and the CSM layer of configuration
applied during NCN Personalizaion. Usually this configuration is done during the first time installation
of CSM software, but if was not done then, it should be done now. See
[Update NCN Passwords](../../operations/security_and_authentication/Update_NCN_Passwords.md) and
[full NCN personalization](../../operations/CSM_product_management/Configure_Non-Compute_Nodes_with_CFS.md#set_root_password)
for more information.

## Stage 0.10 - Continue to Stage 1

Once the above steps have been completed, proceed to [Stage 1](Stage_1.md).
