help = """Add Compute Nodes to the CHN

This procedure adds all Compute nodes to the Customer Highspeed Network (CHN).  In *many* cases this is
not required.  Generalized User access to computes over the CHN is only required in the following cases:

1. **Ingress** Users need to access *all* computes from the site (ssh or otherwise).
2. **Egrss** The HSN has no NAT device in place and the CHN subnet is both large enough and site-routable.

Processing of SLS records will only occur if both the BICAN network exists (CSM >= 1.2) and the
SystemDefaultRoute values has been set to "CHN".  If these conditions are not met, running the
script is a no-op.

Script processing involves:
* Ensuring CHN is large enough to fit all HSN Reservations.
  * If not it's possible that either a NAT device is in place, or
  * This procedure is not required, or
  * The CHN was truly not large enough to accomodate all the compute nodes (typical).
