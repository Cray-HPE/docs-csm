# Usage
This repo will house documentation for known issues that occurred while running upgrades during testing.  

The layout will consist of a directory per stage with 2 files per directory. These files will be *KNOWN_ISSUES.md* and *REFERENCE_MATERIAL.md*

**KNOW_ISSUES.md** will house all known issues that occurred during install that a customer might possibly run into and the fix or work around.  Please make sure you match your stage and issue up correctly in the document. 

**REFERENCE_MATERIAL.md** will contain all additional information.  For example, this file should contain what the changes are and any important information that the end user should know going forward.
