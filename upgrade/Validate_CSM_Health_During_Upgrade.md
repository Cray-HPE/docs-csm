# Validate CSM Health During a CSM Upgrade

- Before performing the health validation, be sure that at least 15 minutes have elapsed
  since the CSM services were upgraded. This allows the various Kubernetes resources to
  initialize and start.
- If the site does not use UAIs, then skip UAS and UAI validation. If UAIs are used, then
  before validating UAS and UAI, first validate any products that configure UAS (such as
  Cray Analytics and Cray Programming Environment); the procedures for this are
  beyond the scope of this document. Failures in UAI creation that result
  from incorrect or incomplete installation of these products will generally take the form of UAIs stuck in
  `waiting` state, trying to set up volume mounts.
- Although it is not recommended, the [Booting CSM `barebones` image](../operations/validate_csm_health.md#5-booting-csm-barebones-image)
  test may be skipped if all compute nodes are active running application workloads.

1. (`ncn-m002#`) If a typescript session is already running in the shell, then first stop it with the `exit` command.

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Start a typescript.

    ```bash
    script -af /root/csm_upgrade.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).post_upgrade_health_validation.txt
    export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
    ```

    If additional shells are opened during this procedure, then record those with typescripts as well. When resuming a procedure
    after a break, always be sure that a typescript is running before proceeding.

1. Validate CSM health.

    See [Validate CSM Health](../operations/validate_csm_health.md).

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Stop typescripts.

    For any typescripts that were started during the health validation procedure, stop them with the `exit` command.

1. (`ncn-m002#`) Backup upgrade logs and typescript files to a safe location.

    1. If any typescript files are on different NCNs, then copy them to `/root` on `ncn-m002`.

    1. Create tar file containing the logs and typescript files.

        > If any typescript file names are not of the form `csm_upgrade.*.txt`, then append their names
        > to the following `tar` command in order to include them.

        ```bash
        TARFILE="csm_upgrade.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).logs.tgz"
        tar -czvf "/root/${TARFILE}" /root/csm_upgrade.*.txt /root/output.log
        ```

    1. Upload the tar file into S3.

        This step requires that the Cray Command Line Interface is configured on the node. This should have already
        been done on `ncn-m002` during the upgrade process. If needed, see [Configure the Cray CLI](../operations/configure_cray_cli.md).

        ```bash
        cray artifacts create config-data "${TARFILE}" "/root/${TARFILE}"
        ```
