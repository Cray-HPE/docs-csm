# CVE-2021-22555 CVE-2021-33909

This procedure covers patching `CVE-2021-22555` and `CVE-2021-33909` on Shasta V1.4.X (and upgrades CSM to v0.9.5).  
These special directions are only for Linux dependencies, such as the kernel and internal packages compiled against the kernel.

A high-level overview of the procedure is as follows:

- install the new kernel directly to NCNs
- delete the existing artifacts from S3
- upload the new artifacts to S3
- reboot NCNs

Procedures:

<a name="preparation"></a>
## Preparation

1. Start a typescript to capture the commands and output from this procedure.
   ```bash
   ncn-m001# script -af csm-update.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt
   ncn-m001# export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
   ```

   > **`NOTE:`** Installed CSM versions may be listed from the product catalog using:
   >
   > ```
   > ncn-m001# kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o jsonpath='{.data.csm}' | yq r -j - | jq -r 'to_entries[] | .key' | sort -V
   > 0.9.2
   > 0.9.3
   > 0.9.4
   > ```

3. Set `CSM_DISTDIR` to the directory of the extracted release distribution for CSM 0.9.5:

   > **`NOTE:`** Use `--no-same-owner` and `--no-same-permissions` options to `tar` when extracting a CSM release 
   > distribution as `root` to ensure the current `umask` value.

   If using a release distribution:
   ```
   ncn-m001# tar --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions -zxvf csm-0.9.5.tar.gz
   ncn-m001# export CSM_DISTDIR="$(pwd)/csm-0.9.5"
   ```

4. Set `CSM_RELEASE_VERSION` to the version reported by `${CSM_DISTDIR}/lib/version.sh`:

   ```
   ncn-m001# CSM_RELEASE_VERSION="$(${CSM_DISTDIR}/lib/version.sh --version)"
   ncn-m001# echo $CSM_RELEASE_VERSION
   ```
   
5. Install/upgrade CSI.

   ```bash
   linux# rpm -Uvh --force ${CSM_DISTDIR}/rpm/cray/csm/sle-15sp2/x86_64/cray-site-init-*.x86_64.rpm
   ```

6. Download and install/upgrade the _latest_ documentation RPM. If this machine does not have direct internet access
   these RPMs will need to be externally downloaded and then copied to be installed.

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# rpm -Uvh https://storage.googleapis.com/csm-release-public/shasta-1.4/docs-csm-install/docs-csm-install-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```
   
7. Set `CSM_SCRIPTDIR` to the scripts directory included in the docs-csm-install RPM for the CSM 0.9.5 patch:

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# export CSM_SCRIPTDIR=/usr/share/doc/metal/upgrade/0.9/csm-0.9.5/scripts
   ```

<a name="run-validation-checks-pre-upgrade"></a>
## Run Validation Checks (Pre-Upgrade)

It is important to first verify a healthy starting state. To do this, run the
[CSM validation checks](../../../008-CSM-VALIDATION.md). If any problems are
found, correct them and verify the appropriate validation checks before
proceeding.

<a name="run-cve-patch"></a>
## Run CVE Patch Script

The `run-patch.sh` script expects that the `TOKEN` environment variable is set. Either set this to a valid token of 
your choosing or get a new one using the following:

```bash
ncn-m001# export TOKEN=$(curl -k -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=admin-client \
  -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
  https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token | jq -r '.access_token')
```

The script also expects that the Cray CLI is configured and authenticated. 
Please see [Initialize cray CLI](../../../006-CSM-PLATFORM-INSTALL.md#initialize-cray-cli) for more information on 
how to do this.

Run the `run-patch.sh` script. This does a few things: 
   1. Updates all the NCNs via `zypper` to have the latest patched packages.
   2. Patches the kernel/initrd/squash image to have the correctly patched assets.
   3. Applies a pod priority to essential deployments to ensure that they are scheduled when rebooting the NCNs.
   
      **This step requires the latest SUSE updates tarball has been extracted and installed (i.e., synced with Nexus).**
   
      **Please see section, "Install SLE for V1.4.2A-security0821 Patch" in the main patch README if you have not already.**
    
       ```
       ncn-m001# "${CSM_SCRIPTDIR}/run-patch.sh"
       ```
    
       > **DO NOT REBOOT**
       > 
       > The `zypper` commands issued by the `run-patch.sh` script may indicate a reboot is needed at several points during the
       > script run but this will happen in a later step so do not reboot the NCNs yet.


<a name="reboot-ncns"></a>
## Reboot NCNs

Reference the [Reboot NCNs procedure](operations/node_management/Reboot_NCNs.md).




<a name="validate-new-kernel"></a>
## Validate NCNs Running Patched Kernel

1. Start a typescript to capture the commands and output from this procedure.
   ```bash
   ncn-m001# script -af csm-update-post-reboot.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt
   ncn-m001# export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
   ```

2. Setup `CSM_DISTDIR` to point toward the location where the extracted csm-0.9.5 tarball.
   > If the tarball was not extracted to `~/csm-0.9.5`, then provide the alternative path instead.
   ```bash
   ncn-m001# CSM_DISTDIR=~/csm-0.9.5
   ```

3. Once a system has booted, verify the new kernel is running on each NCN. This should match `5.3.18-24.75-default`, which is the version 
of the kernel that addresses the CVE.

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# cd "$CSM_DISTDIR"
   ncn-m001# pdsh -w $(./lib/list-ncns.sh| paste -sd,) "uname -r"
   + Getting admin-client-auth secret
   + Obtaining access token
   + Querying SLS
   ncn-s003: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-s002: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-s001: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-m001: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-m002: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-m003: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-w003: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-w001: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ncn-w002: 5.3.18-24.75-default
   ```
   > Alternatively, login to each NCN and run the following command to get get currently running kernel version.
   > ```bash
   > ncn# uname -r
   > ```

<a name="setup-nexus"></a>
## Setup Nexus

Run `lib/setup-nexus.sh` to configure Nexus and upload new CSM RPM
repositories, container images, and Helm charts:

```bash
ncn-m001# cd "$CSM_DISTDIR"
ncn-m001# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh
```

On success, `setup-nexus.sh` will output `OK` on stderr and exit with status
code `0`, e.g.:

```bash
ncn-m001# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh
...
+ Nexus setup complete
setup-nexus.sh: OK
ncn-m001# echo $?
0
```

In the event of an error, consult the [known
issues](../../../006-CSM-PLATFORM-INSTALL.md#known-issues) from the install
documentation to resolve potential problems and then try running
`setup-nexus.sh` again. Note that subsequent runs of `setup-nexus.sh` may
report `FAIL` when uploading duplicate assets. This is ok as long as
`setup-nexus.sh` outputs `setup-nexus.sh: OK` and exits with status code `0`.

<a name="upgrade-services"></a>
## Upgrade Services

1. Run `upgrade.sh` to deploy upgraded CSM applications and services:

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# cd "$CSM_DISTDIR"
   ncn-m001# ./upgrade.sh
   ```

<a name="run-validation-checks-post-upgrade"></a>
## Run Validation Checks (Post-Upgrade)

> **`IMPORTANT:`** Wait at least 15 minutes after
> [`upgrade.sh`](#upgrade-services) completes to let the various Kubernetes
> resources get initialized and started.

Run the following validation checks to ensure that everything is still working
properly after the upgrade:

1. [Platform health checks](../../../008-CSM-VALIDATION.md#platform-health-checks)
2. [Network health checks](../../../008-CSM-VALIDATION.md#network-health-checks)

Other health checks may be run as desired.


<a name="verify-version"></a>
## Verify CSM Version in Product Catalog

1. Verify the CSM version has been updated in the product catalog. Verify that the
   following command includes version `0.9.5`:

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o jsonpath='{.data.csm}' | yq r -j - | jq -r 'to_entries[] | .key' | sort -V
   0.9.2
   0.9.3
   0.9.4
   0.9.5
   ```

2. Confirm the `import_date` reflects the timestamp of the upgrade:

   ```bash
   ncn-m001# kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o jsonpath='{.data.csm}' | yq r  - '"0.9.5".configuration.import_date'
   ```


<a name="exit-typescript"></a>
## Exit Typescript

Remember to exit your typescript.

```bash
ncn-m001# exit
```

It is recommended to save the typescript file for later reference.
